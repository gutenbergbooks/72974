  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In many respects the present volume differs from
the most of those which have been issued by the
Society; there is in it very little history, as commonly
understood. The author, it is true, lived in
a stirring time, and was himself an actor in some of
the incidents which have shed a glory on our naval
records; but his account of these is meagre and of
little importance. The interest which attaches to
his ‘Recollections’ is entirely personal and social;
we have in them sketches roughly drawn, crude,
inartistic, and perhaps on that account the more
valuable, of the life of the time; of the men who
were his companions in the berth, or the gunroom
or the wardroom; on deck, in sport or in
earnest.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all this, there is perhaps little that we did not
know before in an otiose sort of way. We knew
that the men of the time were often coarse in
speech, rude in action; but it may be that the
reality, as portrayed by Commander Gardner,
exceeds anything that we had imagined. It seems
to carry us back to the days of Roderick Random,
and to suggest that there had been but small
improvement since Smollett wrote his celebrated
description. A closer examination will correct this
impression; will convince us that there had, on the
contrary, been a good deal of improvement; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the life was less hard, the manners less rude; and
if the language does not show very much difference,
it has to be considered that Smollett was writing
for the public and Gardner was not; that Smollett’s
dialogues are more or less literary, and Gardner’s
are, for the most part, in the vernacular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Occasionally, indeed, the language has been
modified, or its undue strength merely indicated by
a ——; but where oaths and expletives formed such
a large part of the conversational currency between
intimates; when ‘son of a bitch’ was the usual
equivalent of the modern ‘chappie’ or ‘Johnnie’
or ‘rotter’; when ‘damned’ was everywhere recognised
as a most ordinary intensitive, and ‘damn
your eyes’ meant simply ‘buck up,’ it has been felt
that entirely to bowdlerise the narrative would be to
present our readers with a very imperfect picture of
the life of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Independent of the language, the most striking
feature of the portraits is the universal drunkenness.
It is mentioned as a thing too common to be considered
a fault, though—if carried to excess—an
amiable weakness, which no decent commanding
officer would take serious notice of. Looking down
the lists of old shipmates and messmates, the eye is
necessarily caught by the frequency of such entries
as ‘too fond of grog,’ ‘did not dislike grog,’ ‘passionately
fond of grog,’ ‘a drunken Hun,’ a term of
reprobation as a bully, rather than as a drunkard,
‘fond of gin grog,’ ‘mad from drink,’ ‘insane from
drink,’ and so on, <em>passim</em>. For the officer of the
watch to be drunk scarcely called for comment; it
was only when, in addition to being drunk, he
turned the captain out at midnight to save the ship,
that he narrowly escaped being brought to a court
martial; ‘but we interceded for him, and the business
was looked over’ (p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>It is, of course, familiarly known that during the
later years of the eighteenth century, such drunkenness
was almost more common on shore than afloat;
and when more than half the peerage and the most
distinguished statesmen were ‘habitual drunkards,’
there was, from the social point of view, some
excuse for the many of Gardner’s messmates. For
good or ill, the navy has always been very conservative
in its customs; and at a much later date,
when hard drinking was going out of fashion on
shore, except among very young men, it still continued
prevalent in the navy. Some of our older
officers will remember at least one instance in which
a great public scandal was averted only in consideration
of the social connections of the principal
offender; and courts martial, bringing ruin and disgrace
to the individual, long continued to be painfully
frequent. Absolute reform in this direction
was slow; but there are few things more remarkable
than the change which has come over the service
during the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in the eighteenth century this hard drinking
brought in its train not only the terribly frequent
insanity, such as is recorded in so many of Gardner’s
pages; not only the gross lapses, some of which
Gardner has indicated, but also numerous irregularities,
which we may suspect where we do not
know’, and of which, quarrels and free fights in the
wardroom or in the steerage—such, for instance, as
brought on the series of Phaëton courts martial
(pp. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>–4)—were only one type. Coarse practical
joking among men no longer young was another
characteristic of the life which seems subversive of
true discipline. Here, of course, we are met by the
great change which has everywhere taken place;
and the horse-play of Billy Culmer and his friends—stupid
vulgarity as it now appears—can scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>be considered more childish than the pranks and
hoaxes of Theodore Hook or Grantley Berkeley
twenty or thirty years later. But the very serious
objection to such practices on board ship was that—as
is now common knowledge—the most inveterate
practical joker is the most annoyed when the tables
are turned and he himself is made the victim of the
joke; that quarrels are certain to arise, which, in
a small society and among armed men, are both
dangerous in themselves and detrimental to the
service. It is, too, difficult to draw the line between
practical joking, ragging, or ‘hazing’ and
actual bullying. There is no doubt that they merge
into each other, and, in the present state of public
opinion, could not possibly be tolerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gardner himself, so far as we can judge from his
own story, was a good, capable man, who took the
life around him as quite a matter of course, without
falling into its worst characteristics. He seems, too,
to have been a man of singularly equable temper;
and it is worthy of special notice that, amid much to
annoy and irritate him, he has preferred to say what
is good, rather than what is bad, of his messmates
and superiors. It used to be so very much the
custom to speak evil of dignities, that it is quite
refreshing to meet with a young officer to whom his
captain did not necessarily seem a bullying, tyrannical
blockhead; who could see that the senior
might have a proper motive and have formed a
correct judgment, even though he did thwart the
junior’s wishes or act contrary to the junior’s opinion.
Gardner had, for instance, no particular cause to
love Calder, but he could still speak of him as ‘a
brave and meritorious officer, and of first-rate
abilities, a man that had the service at heart’
(pp. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>, <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>). Leveson Gower he did not like—no
subordinate did; but, though he relates several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>incidents, which of themselves are sufficiently damning,
he does not seem to have set down aught in
malice, nor has he made any spiteful commentary.
His worst remark is ‘I have said enough of him’
(p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>First lieutenants were, of course, the natural
enemies of a youngster; but with few exceptions
his comments, even on them, are good-humoured.
Of one only does he speak bitterly; it is Edward
Hamilton (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>), whose celebrated recapture of
the Hermione might induce us to suspect that
Gardner was merely expressing the spleen roused
by the loss of his kit, did we not remember that, at
this time, Hamilton was only 23, and that he was
but 30 when his active career was brought to a
premature end by a court martial dismissing him
the service for cruelty and oppression. It is true
that he was specially reinstated six months later,
but he never afterwards commanded a sea-going
ship, nor, as an admiral, did he ever hoist his flag.
It is indeed a remarkable fact, and one giving much
food for thought, that other young captains, whose
brilliant courage before the enemy won for them a
reputation little, if at all, inferior to that of Hamilton,
were also tried by court martial for tyrannical and
excessive punishments. It is difficult to avoid the
suspicion that this was in great measure due to utter
want of training in the art of command. The way
in which the ships’ companies were raised, the
vicious characters of the men, almost necessarily led
to severity which easily might and too often did
degenerate into brutality.</p>

<p class='c008'>On all this, however, Gardner offers no opinion.
He took the service as he found it, content to do
his duty honestly and faithfully. The story of his
career, which is related at length in the following
pages, may be summarised from the memoir in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>O’Byrne’s <cite>Naval Biographical Dictionary</cite>, the first
draft of which was almost certainly written from
information supplied by himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>James Anthony Gardner, son of Francis Geary
Gardner, a commander in the navy, who died at
St. Lucia in September 1780, was born at Waterford
in 1770–1. Francis Geary Gardner, captain
of marines, was his brother. Sir Francis Geary
Gardner Lee, who began life as a midshipman
(p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>) and died a lieutenant-colonel of marines,
was a cousin. Two other cousins—Knight and
Lee—captains in the 17th regiment, are mentioned
(p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>), and yet another, ‘son of the late Alderman
Bates of Waterford’ (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>). His grandfather,
James Gardner, who died, a lieutenant in the navy,
in 1755, was, in 1747–8, a lieutenant of the Culloden,
with Captain, afterwards Admiral Sir Francis,
Geary, the godfather of James’s son, who, on 2 February,
1768, married Rachel, daughter of Anthony
Lee of Waterford, and niece of Admiral William
Parry. It will be noticed that the younger Gardner,
having been born in Ireland, son of an Irish mother,
considered himself Irish, is especially Irish in his
sympathies, and that throughout his ‘Recollections’
the word ‘Irish’ is very commonly used as denoting
‘exceptionally good.’</p>

<p class='c008'>From 1775, when he was not more than five
years old, Gardner was borne, as his father’s servant,
on the books of the Boreas, the Conqueror,
and the Ætna; and he might, according to the
custom of the day, have counted these years as part
of his time at sea. As, however, when he went up
for his examination (p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>), he had more sea time
than enough, he only counted it from his entry on
board the Salisbury in December 1783 (p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>).
Really, he first went to sea in May 1782 (p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>the Panther, and in her, under—in succession—Captains
Thomas Piercy and Robert Simonton, he
saw the loss of the Royal George, and was present
at Howe’s relief of Gibraltar and in the ‘rencounter’
with the combined fleets of France and Spain off
Cape Spartel on 20 October, 1782 (pp. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>, 27, 30
<em>seq.</em>).</p>

<p class='c008'>During the ensuing peace he served on the
Newfoundland and Home stations, as midshipman
and master’s mate in the Salisbury, 50, flagship of
Vice-Admiral John Campbell (pp. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>–55); Orestes,
18, Captain Manley Dixon (pp. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>–63); Edgar, 74,
flagship of Rear-Admirals the Hon. John Leveson
Gower and Joseph Peyton (pp. <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>–96); Barfleur, 98,
bearing the flags of Admirals Roddam, the Hon.
Samuel Barrington, Sir John Jervis, John Elliot
and Jonathan Faulknor (pp. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>–120), and Queen,
98, Captain John Hutt (pp. <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>–5). After a further
service, chiefly in the Mediterranean in the Berwick,
74, Captains Sir John Collins, William Shield.
George Campbell and George Henry Towry (pp.
<a href='#Page_126'>126</a>–154); in the Gorgon, 44, Captain James Wallis,
for a passage to England (pp. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>–171); and in
the Victory, 110, Captain John Knight, at Portsmouth
(pp. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>–7), he was promoted, 12 January
1795, to be lieutenant of the Hind, 28, Captains
Richard Lee and John Bazely (the younger), on the
North American and Irish stations, and in January
1797 was sent in to Plymouth in charge of a prize,
La Favorite privateer, of 8 guns and 60 men (pp.
<a href='#Page_178'>178</a>, 202).</p>

<p class='c008'>His next appointments were—8 March 1798,
to the Blonde, 32, Captain Daniel Dobree, under
whom he assisted in conveying troops to Holland
in August 1799 (pp. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>–225); 13 April, 1801, to
the Brunswick, 74, Captain George Hopewell
Stephens, which, after a year in the West Indies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>returned home and was paid off in July 1802 (pp.
<a href='#Page_226'>226</a>–249). After a short service as agent of transports
at Portsmouth (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>), he was appointed, in
January 1806, in charge of the signal station at
Fairlight in Sussex, where he continued till 7
December 1814 (pp. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>–263). From that date he
remained on half pay as a lieutenant, till on 26
November 1830, he was placed on the retired list
with the rank of commander.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reading this summary of Gardner’s service, in
connection with the longer narrative, we are
naturally inclined to say: Another instance of a
good man choked out of the line of promotion by
want of interest; there must have been something
radically wrong with the system that permitted want
of interest to shelve, at the age of 32, a sober,
punctual and capable officer, with a blameless record
and distinguished certificates. But would such a
presentment of the case be quite correct? Gardner
was excellently well connected, and had relations or
good friends—including the comptroller himself
(p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>)—in many different departments of the public
service. He must have had remarkably good
interest; and we are forced to look elsewhere for
what can only be called his failure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first reason for it—one, too, that has
damaged many a young officer’s prospects—was his
determination to pick and choose his service. This
is apparent throughout. He wasted his interest in
getting out of what he considered disagreeable
employments. He quarrelled with Captain Calder
and wearied Sir Henry Martin by his refusal to go
to the West Indies, as it ‘did not suit my inclination’
(p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>); he scouted McArthur’s suggestion to
try his fortune on board the Victory (p. <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>), and
got himself sent to the Gorgon for a passage to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>England, only to find that his cleverness cost
him five months’ time and the whole of his kit
(pp. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>–3). The same daintiness is to be observed
throughout. But if one thing is more certain than
another in calculating the luck of the service, it is
that a whole-hearted devotion to it, a readiness to
go anywhere and to do anything, pays the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later on, there was another reason for Gardner’s
want of this readiness. He married early—on
11 December 1798—and his future career does not
contravene the frequently expressed opinion of our
most distinguished admirals, from Lord St. Vincent
downwards, that—as far as the service is concerned—a
young lieutenant might as well cut his throat as
marry. ‘D’ye mind me,’ says the old song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘D’ye mind me! a sailor should be, every inch,</div>
      <div class='line'>All as one as a piece of the ship;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and for a young man, with a young wife at home, that
is impossible. His allegiance is divided; the wife
on shore has the biggest share and continually calls
for more, till the husband gets a home appointment—a
guardo, a coast-guard, or a signal station—pleasant
for the time, but fatal to all chance of promotion.
No doubt there have been exceptions. It
would not be impossible to cite names of officers who
married as lieutenants and rose to high rank; but
either under peculiar conditions of service, or because
the wife has had sufficient strength of mind to
prevent her standing in the way of her husband’s
profession; possibly even she may have forwarded
him in it. <i><span lang="la">Exceptio probat regulam</span></i>; but Gardner
was not one. His direct connection with the service
ended with the peace in 1814. It does not appear
that he either asked for or wished for any further
employment; but spent the rest of his life in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>peaceful and contented retirement in the bosom of
his family, at Peckham, where he died on 24 September
1846, in his 76th year. He was buried in the
churchyard of St. Mary’s, Newington Butts, where
a head-stone once marked the site of the grave.
But the churchyard has been turned into a pleasure-ground,
and the position of the stone or the grave
is now unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ‘Recollections’ which by the kindness of the
authors grandsons, Francis William and Henry
James Gardner, we are now permitted to print, were
written in 1836, and corrected, to some small extent,
in later years. We have no information of the
sources from which he composed them. He must
have had his logs; and we may suppose either that
these took the form of journals, or that he had also
kept a journal with some regularity. Certainly it is
not probable that, without some register, he could
have given the lists of his shipmates, correct even—in
very many cases—to the Christian names. That
their characters and the various highly flavoured
anecdotes were matters of memory is more easily
believed.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is, in one sense, the most remarkable
thing about the work is the strong literary seasoning
which it often betrays. The manuscript is a little
volume (fcap. 4to) written on both sides of the paper,
in a small neat hand. This, of itself, is evidence
that Gardner—leaving school, after six or seven
broken years, at the age of twelve—did not consider,
or rather was not allowed to consider, his education
finished in all branches except in the line of his profession.
Of the way in which it was continued, we
have no knowledge. It is quite possible that Macbride,
the drunken and obscene schoolmaster of the
Edgar, may, in his sober intervals, have helped to
inspire him with some desire of learning. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>educational powers of Pye, the schoolmaster of the
Salisbury and of the Barfleur, can scarcely have
stretched beyond the working of a lunar. In the
Berwick he was shipmates with the Rev. Alexander
John Scott—in after years chaplain of the Victory
and Nelsons foreign secretary—a man of literary
aptitudes, who was ‘always going on shore to make
researches after antiquities’ (p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>), and Gardner
may sometimes have been allowed to accompany
him in his rambles.</p>

<p class='c008'>However this may have been, it is very noteworthy
that a tincture of polite learning was shared
by many of his messmates. To those whose notions
of life afloat are gathered from Roderick Random
and other descriptions of the seamy side of the
service, it will seem incredible that such should have
been the case. We are not here concerned to prove
it as a general proposition. It is enough to refer to
the particular instances before us—that of Gardner
and his messmates. He tells us that Macredie,
who was with him in the Edgar, and afterwards in
the Barfleur, was ‘an excellent scholar, well acquainted
with Greek and Latin, ancient history and
mathematics’ (p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>), which must mean something,
even if we allow a good deal for exaggeration. In
the Edgar they were with that disreputable but
amiable and talented sinner, Macbride; and it was
also in the Edgar that the assumption of Homeric
characters was a common sport, in which Macredie
figured as Ajax Telamon, Culverhouse as Diomede,
and Pringle won the name of ‘Ponderous and Huge’
(pp. <a href='#Page_84'>84</a>, 93).</p>

<p class='c008'>This does not, perhaps, go for very much; but
it cannot be lost sight of that, as concerns Gardner,
it was accompanied by a readiness to apply quotations
from Popes <cite>Iliad</cite> and from the <cite>Aeneid</cite>, sometimes
in Dryden’s version, sometimes in the original. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>was certainly, also, as familiar with <cite>Hudibras</cite> as
ever Alan Quatermain was with <cite>The Ingoldsby
Legends</cite>. Shakespeare he does not seem to have
studied; and though it is but a small thing in comparison
that he should have read <cite>Ossian</cite> and <cite>A
Sentimental Journey</cite>, his knowledge of, his familiarity
with, Roman history may be allowed as a makeweight,
unless indeed—which is quite possible—it
was drilled into him by Scott on each separate
occasion. Thus, when the Berwick goes to Tunis
and Porto Farino, he is reminded of the fate of
Regulus (p. <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>); he connects Trapani with the
destruction of the Roman fleet under Claudius
(p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), and knows that the concluding battle of the
first Punic war—the battle which, as Mahan has
shown, decided the result of the second Punic war—was
fought off the Egades (p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>). Incomparably
more attention is nowadays paid to the instruction
of our youngsters; but we are confident that very
few of them could note such things in their journal
unless specially coached up in them by a friendly
senior.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this, again, there have been exceptions.
Until recently there has probably always been
a sprinkling of officers who kept up and increased
the knowledge of Latin they brought from Eton or
Westminster<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> or other schools of classical learning;
and Hannay, the novelist, who had a personal acquaintance
with gunroom life of sixty years ago,
has represented the midshipmen and mates of his
day bandying quotations from Horace or Virgil with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>a freedom which many have thought ridiculous, but
which, we must admit, might sometimes be met
with. We were told by an officer who served in the
Hibernia under the flag of Sir William Parker, that
it was easy to fit names to all the principal characters
in Hannay’s novelettes; and it may be assumed that
what was true for the captains was equally true for
the midshipmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such familiarity with the Latin poets was, of
course, very exceptional then; it has now, we fancy,
entirely dropped out. The Latin which our present
youngsters bring into the service must be extremely
little, and they have no opportunity of continuing
the study of it; and though English history and
naval history form part of the curriculum at Osborne
and Dartmouth, there is but little inducement to
a young officer to read more when he goes afloat.
But there are certainly many of our older officers
who would say that a sound and intelligent knowledge
of history is more likely to be profitable to
the average captain or admiral than the most
absolute familiarity with the processes of the differential
or integral calculus.</p>

<p class='c008'>A considerable, and what to many will be a most
interesting, part of the volume is occupied by lists of
names and thumb-nail sketches of character. No
attempt has been made to amplify these beyond
filling in dates and Christian names [in square
brackets] from <cite>Navy-lists</cite> and <em>Pay-books</em>. More
would generally have been impracticable, for most
of the names are unknown to history; and where
otherwise, anything like full notices would have
enormously swelled the volume, without any adequate
gain. It has seemed better to add a mere
reference to some easily accessible memoir, either in
the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> (<cite>D.N.B.</cite>),
Charnock’s <cite>Biographia Navalis</cite>, Marshall’s <cite>Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>Naval Biography</cite>, or O’Byrne’s <cite>Naval Biographical
Dictionary</cite>; sometimes also to James’s <cite>Naval History</cite>,
Schomberg’s <cite>Naval Chronology</cite>, or to Beatson’s
<cite>Naval and Military Memoirs</cite>—all books which are
quite common, and are or ought to be in every
naval library.</p>

<p class='c008'>It remains only for the Editors to express their
grateful thanks to the Messrs. Gardner, who not
only permit them to publish the ‘Recollections,’ but
supplied them with a copy of the MS., typed at their
expense; to the Very Rev. the Dean of Waterford,
who has most kindly had all the registers at Waterford
searched (though vainly) in the endeavour to determine
the exact date of Commander Gardner’s
birth; and to the numerous friends and even
strangers who have so kindly helped them in answering
the various queries which have presented
themselves. These are too many to name; but the
Editors must, in a special degree, mention their
obligations to Commander C. N. Robinson, R.N.,
whose very exceptional knowledge of the byways of
naval literature has been most generously put at
their service. That some of their queries have
remained unanswered and that explanatory notes
are thus sometimes wanting will serve to emphasise
the importance of the assistance referred to. What,
for instance, is the meaning of the phrase ‘My hat’s
off’ (p. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>)? Apparently ‘Not a word!’ but why?
or again, what are ‘ugly podreen faces’ (p. <a href='#Page_214'>214</a>)?
To a mere Englishman the epithet looks as if it
might be Irish; but Irish dictionaries and three competent
Irish scholars are positive that it is not.
Once more, they express their warmest thanks for
the help that has been so freely given them.</p>

      <div class='line in6'>To splice a chain cable</div>
      <div class='line'>Or get a sheer hulk under way.</div>
      <div class='line'>But to my veteran friends,</div>
      <div class='line'>I submit here my odds and my ends.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I begin at the good old times when luxury was
not known in the service, when we were carrying
on the war against the Yankees and the French.
My father, the late Captain Francis Geary Gardner,
was appointed through the interest of Admiral
Francis Geary<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> (afterwards Sir Francis), and of my
mother’s uncle, Admiral William Parry,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to be
master of the Boreas, a new frigate of 28 guns
fitting at Chatham, and commanded by Captain
Charles Thompson, with the promise of Lord Sandwich
(then first lord of the admiralty) to be promoted
when opportunity offered; which promise his lordship
performed by appointing him lieutenant of the
Conqueror, 74, as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has pleased God to give me a good memory,
and I have perfect recollection of almost every
circumstance from very early life. My objection in
writing my naval recollections is to amuse my family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>when I am moored head and stern; and I shall first
state for their information that my naval ancestors
held the rank from admiral of the white to that
of commander, and in the soldiering line from
general to major. Having settled this point I
shall now commence by stating that, while the
Boreas was fitting, we took lodgings at the house of
a cross old maid at Brompton, named Patty Pankhurst,
who I have reason to remember; for having
unfortunately cut up some carrots she had for dinner,
and upsetting her potatoes down an alley, she for
this innocent amusement never forgave me. I well
recollect a ghostly story the old hussy related about
the boatswain of the Bonny Broom who was
drowned going off to his ship near Gillingham, and
how he used to be seen cruising up and down along
the shore and hailing ‘Board the Bonny Broom
ahoy!’ three times, and then go to the churchyard
exactly at 1 o’clock and disappear! She would kindly
tell me this at night, adding ‘Hark, don’t you hear
him?’ and then I would be afraid to go to bed.
This had ten times more effect upon my nerves
than the little cane she kept for active service,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With which she laid about more busily</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the Amazonian dame Penthesile (<cite>Hudibras</cite>);</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and if Patty would only say ‘I think I hear the
boatswain,’ I would be off without further trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>My father, mother, and Charley Buchan, the
purser, took it into their heads to walk to Cobham
on a Sunday in very warm weather. When they
got there, it was near church time in the afternoon;
they wanted to get dinner, but nothing could be
obtained at any of the houses; and when asked if
they had anything, the answer was, ‘We have ate
it all up,’ and Buchan would reply, ‘The devil choke
you with it.’ He then set off to forage while we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>remained at an inn. After waiting some time we
heard a shouting, and on going out saw him marching
at the head of the people who were going to
church, waving a shoulder of mutton and singing a
stave from the 41st Psalm:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Happy the man whose tender care</div>
      <div class='line'>Relieves the poor distressed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On his coming in, the landlord took my father
aside and requested to know if the gentleman
(meaning Buchan) was right in his intellect. To
keep up the joke my father told him he was subject
to sudden fits of insanity and would frequently bite
people, and always took the piece out. ‘God save
us!’ said the landlord; ‘I wish his honour had gone
to some other house, for I don’t like the look of
him.’ The mutton, however, was put down to
roast, and when about half done was brought in, and
the landlord, bending his eye, not on vacancy but
on Buchan, said he hoped everything was to his
honour’s liking, and adding that when the company
had dined he would be glad to have the room, as it
was engaged for the evening; upon which Buchan
got up and, flourishing the carving knife, sang with
a voice of thunder, ‘Farewell to Lochaber,’ which
made the landlord back out as if he had been at the
levee. We soon after relieved him from his troubles
and returned to Brompton.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the ship was fitted we sailed for
Sheerness; and on paying a visit to the Mars, 74, a
guard-ship at Black Stakes (the captain being a
relation of my mother) we got swamped alongside,
but luckily escaped drowning. While at Sheerness
we had an invitation to dine with a merchant whose
name was Simmers, and among the number Buchan
the purser was invited. At the table sat Mr.
Simmers’ dog Pompey, with a plate laid for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>It was laughable to hear Buchan (who was a wag)
ask Pompey if he should have the pleasure of drinking
wine with him; and on taking leave he gave the
dog an invitation to dine on board with him the next
day, saying he should be most happy to see him and
his father (Mr. Simmers), and to be sure not to come
without him. The old man felt the rebuke and
gave no more invitations.</p>

<p class='c008'>After getting our powder we sailed for the
Downs, and soon after proceeded to Spithead, where
we remained a short time until we received orders to
take shipwrights to Halifax from Portsmouth and
Plymouth; and when everything was ready, we got
under way from St. Helen’s in the evening; but
in consequence of the man in the chains giving the
wrong soundings—the leadline being foul—the ship
struck on the Dean, where the old Invincible, 74,
was lost, and after considerable damage was got off
and returned to Spithead and then to Portsmouth
Harbour to refit. My father was tried by a court
martial and honourably acquitted. While in the
harbour alongside the jetty, a cat flew at the sentry
on the gangway and fixed on his shoulder, and it
was with great difficulty the animal could be removed;
the sentry fell in a fit and dropped his
musket overboard and was subject to fits while he
remained in the ship. The Boreas when refitted
was ordered to the West Indies, and I left the ship
for school,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and again joined her on her return, and
sailed for Plymouth and went into Hamoaze, when
Lord Sandwich promoted my father and appointed
him fifth Lieutenant of the Conqueror, 74, fitting in
the harbour.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>We took lodgings at the house of a hop merchant
in North Corner Street; he was also carpenter of a
line-of-battle ship, and a very eccentric character.
His name was John Cowdray, and on his table linen
was marked in large letters Sir John Cowdray,
Baronet and Knight of the Bath. His wife was
also a strange being and was perpetually calling out
‘Bet Waters! Bet Waters!’ (the name of her servant)
from morning until night, with a voice that, sounded
like a sow-gelder’s flageolet. The day before my
father left the Boreas, he gave at this house a dinner
to the captain and officers; and I remember his
saying to Captain Thompson that Sir Francis Drake
taught the people of Plymouth to walk upright: before
that they went on all fours. He had hardly made
the observation when the door opened, and in came
one of the servants upon all fours, having fallen and
upset a couple of roast fowls with all the contents
upon Sir John Cowdray’s fine carpet, and bespattered
my father’s white lappels. ‘There,’ says Captain
Thompson, ‘is a specimen of grown people taught
to walk upright by Sir Francis Drake.’</p>

<p class='c008'>While the Boreas lay in Hamoaze, a violent
quarrel took place between her crew and that of the
Foudroyant, and several hard battles were fought, to
the advantage of the former, who always came off
conqueror when not overpowered by numbers. We
had a fellow by the name of Waddle who was coxswain
of the pinnace, and a noted boxer. This man
fought and beat three of the best men belonging to
the Foudroyant, one after the other, to the great
satisfaction of his shipmates, who made a subscription
and handsomely rewarded their champion.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the time this frigate was in the West
Indies, and also on the home service, she sailed
superior to any of the men of war, and was one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the first of the copper-bottomed. The following
are the names of the officers that I can recollect:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Charles Thompson</span>, Esq., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1799]. A baronet and vice-admiral of the red.—[<em>D.N.B.</em>]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>John Laugharne</span>, 1st Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1819]. A vice-admiral; a most indefatigable first lieutenant,
and one of the best seamen in the service.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Joseph Peyton</span>, 2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1816]. A rear-admiral [superannuated].</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Charles Holmes Everitt</span>, 2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1807]. An admiral [took the name of Calmady].</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[Richard] Hawford</span>, 2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>He commanded the Rover sloop of war when she upset in a
white squall on the West India Station and all hands unfortunately
perished [on or about 29 October 1781].</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Francis Geary Gardner</span>, Master.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A captain in the Royal Navy. He was considered one of
the first seamen in the navy, and also a most skilful pilot for the
coast of America.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Charles Buchan</span>, Purser.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A most worthy gentleman.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Correy</span>, Surgeon.
Dead. Remember little of him. I believe he was drowned when
the Royal George upset.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[William] Williams</span>, Lieutenant of Marines.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>J[ohn] Monkton</span>, Mate.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1827]. A rear-admiral. He was first lieutenant of the Marlborough,
74, in Lord Howe’s action, June 1, 1794, and behaved with
great bravery. He was made commander and soon after got his
post rank. He commanded the Mars, 74, the flagship of Admiral
Berkeley. When the promotion of flags took place, to the
astonishment of every person, he was placed on the <em>retired</em> list of
rear-admirals.—[Marshall, iii. 12.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Lenox Thompson</span>, Mate.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1835]. A post captain [1802]; a very good officer.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>George Wangford</span>, Midshipman.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. See Edgar.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>[Jacob] Swanson</span>, Gunner.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A very good man, but had a very bad wife.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[Thomas] Wilson</span>, Surgeon’s Mate.</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncertain. He could play a little on the flute, and used to annoy
all hands by everlastingly playing the King’s Minuet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above are all the officers I can recollect that
belonged to the Boreas.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

      <div class='line'>My Lord, you give a fight in sham,</div>

      <div class='line'>And that’s your Lordship’s epigram.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>My father joined the Conqueror in December 1777
as fifth and then fourth lieutenant, the late Admiral
Thomas Lord Graves captain, fitting in Hamoaze;
and after a cruise or two the ship was ordered to
Spithead to join the fleet assembled there for the
sham fight, and to be reviewed by his Majesty King
George III. Sir Thomas Pye, admiral of the white,
was port admiral and senior officer, and Admiral
Keppel (blue at the main) had his flag on board the
Prince George, 98. When his Majesty went afloat,
the flag officers and captains attended in their
barges, Sir Thomas Pye leading the van. The
royal standard was hoisted on board the Prince
George, and a grand salute took place from the
whole of the men of war, which was repeated
several times during the day. Thousands of boats
full of spectators attended at Spithead; several of
the nobility were on board the Conqueror. The
ladies didn’t much like the firing, and one of them
had a tooth knocked out by biting the frame of the
quarter-gallery window when the after gun on the
main deck went off. Soon after the review, a fleet
being ordered to sail for America with all possible
dispatch, we were sent to Plymouth to join them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>They consisted of the following men of war under
the command of the Honourable John Byron, vice-admiral

<p class='c008'>The fleet sailed from Cawsand Bay in 1778
soon after the review and a short time before
Keppel’s action, and I left the ship for school. It
is in the remembrance of many that this fleet had
a dreadful passage and separated. The Princess
Royal arrived at her destination alone, and it was
a long time before they could be collected. The
Conqueror was eleven weeks on her passage, and
had three hundred of her crew in the sick list. The
Invincible put into St. John’s, Newfoundland, in
distress, and all the squadron suffered more or less.
I hope it will not be presumptuous to state that my
father was considered one of the best seamen in the
service, and a very able and skilful pilot, particularly
for the coast of America; which is well known to
some of the oldest officers of the present day. In
this gale he exerted himself with such ability that
when Admiral Hyde Parker hoisted his flag on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>board the Conqueror, he told my father that he
should remember him when opportunity offered,
which promise he performed by removing him to
the Princess Royal, his flagship, when he took the
command of the fleet on the return of Admirals
Byron and Barrington to England. The rear-admiral
was a very strict officer, and from his
austere disposition got the nickname of Old
Vinegar, and it was a very difficult task for an
officer to get into his good graces. When he
shifted his flag (blue at the mizen) from the Conqueror
to the Princess Royal in the West Indies, he
also removed Mr. McInerheny, the master of the
former (an officer and seaman of first-rate abilities),
to the flagship, and, in February 1780, he promoted
my father and appointed him Captain of the Etna,
wishing him success as a meritorious officer and
deserving of promotion, and said he would recommend
him to Admiral Rodney as soon as he should
take command of the fleet. I shall just mention
that Patrick Gibson,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> who died about four years ago,
aged one hundred and eleven, was purser of the
Princess Royal and a messmate of my father’s.
I shall state further particulars of this extraordinary
man when I come to the Blonde.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following are the names of the officers.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Thos. Graves</span>, Esq., Captain and then Commodore.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1802]. An admiral of the white. When made a rear-admiral
he had his flag on board the London, 98, at the Chesapeake, but
failed in preventing the Count de Grasse getting there with
succours for the American Army. Owing to this unfortunate
circumstance, Lord Cornwallis was obliged to capitulate with
5,000 men to the Americans. He had his flag on board the
Ramillies when that ship foundered in the gale of September 1782,
coming home with the West India convoy, of which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>charge, and showed uncommon presence of mind in the dreadful
situation that ship was in. The Ramillies was lying-to under a
main sail<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> (a sail that a ship should never be laid to under) on
the larboard tack with her head to the westward, when she was
taken aback, and if her mast had not gone she must have
foundered. She had six feet of water in the hold, which increased
to nine feet, and it was found impossible to keep her free. Fortunately
the gale abated for a short time, and the ship’s company
were removed to a merchantman, the admiral being the last to
quit. He did everything that an able seaman could do to save
her, in setting a good example and showing undaunted courage
in a situation that would have shaken the nerves of the philosophers
of Greece and Rome. Admiral Graves was port admiral
at Plymouth, and when the war broke out in 1793 he hoisted his
flag on board the Royal Sovereign, 110; was in the action of the
1st of June 1794; was wounded and made a peer.—[<em>D.N.B.</em>]</p>

<p class='c017'>The name of the master of this school was Orchard,
and a very good man he was; but who the devil
taught him navigation is more than I can say. He
was a great disciplinarian, and used to flourish with
direful sway an infernal horsewhip, that I have
reason to remember. It was called ‘black pudding,’
and he was no way stingy in serving it out. I
recollect one of the scholars coming very late one
morning quite out of breath, and when asked the
reason by old Orchard, he replied: ‘The man
said that the boy said that the woman said that Mr.
Browell said if he did not hold his tongue he would
knock him down dead.’ This set the whole school
in a roar of laughter, and I for one got three or four
cuts across the shoulder with the before-mentioned
black pudding, that I have perfect remembrance of
to the present day. While at this school we used
to bathe in a lake that runs near the Horse-field
on the Stoke Road. On one occasion we drove a
cow into the mud so that we could not extricate the
animal, and it was fast sinking up to the neck. A
militia regiment happened to be encamped near the
spot, and it took several of the soldiers a long time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to get it out. I never shall forget the terror we
were in when the owner swore he would send the
whole of us to jail; and Buck Adams, the keeper of
the Bridewell, passing near the spot by chance, we
thought he was come to seize us, and several of the
party set off and ran naked into the town covered
with mud. We had to pay near twenty shillings to
make the matter up, besides treating the soldiers,
who enjoyed the fun. As I’m in a hurry to get to
sea again I shall only relate one or two circumstances
that happened before I took my departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was standing on Gosport beach when the
prisoners were landed from some of the prizes taken
by Rear-Admiral Kempenfelt (the ablest tactician
in the navy), who with only twelve sail of the line
by a masterly manœuvre captured most of the convoy
from the French admiral, Count de Guichen, who
had nineteen sail of the line, and frustrated the
expedition. A party of soldiers assembled on the
beach to escort them to Forton prison, a lieutenant
of the navy and several midshipmen also attending,
when a <em>posse</em> of women rushed out of Rime’s ‘noted
alley’ and, pointing to the soldiers, sang the following
beautiful ditty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Don’t you see the ships a-coming?</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Don’t you see them in full sail?</div>
      <div class='line'>Don’t you see the ships a-coming</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With the prizes at their tail?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! my little rolling sailor,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Oh! my little rolling he;</div>
      <div class='line'>I do love a jolly sailor,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Blithe and merry might he be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sailors, they get all the money,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Soldiers they get none but brass;</div>
      <div class='line'>I do love a jolly sailor.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Soldiers they may kiss—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! my little rolling sailor,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Oh! my little rolling he;</div>
      <div class='line'>I do love a jolly sailor,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Soldiers may be damned for me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Then, catching hold of the lieutenant and midshipmen,
they began to hug and kiss them, and it
was some time before they could get out of their
clutches. They then began to pelt the soldiers,
who took it very patiently and seemed very glad
when the order was given to march with the
Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>In holiday time we used to set off to a place
called Grange, about two miles from Gosport, where
the gipsies had a camp, and many a desperate battle
we have had with them. I well recollect about
fourteen of us going out, and after many manœuvres
we succeeded in capturing some of their donkeys and
rode off in triumph; but the swarthy squad got a
reinforcement, with which they attacked us; and
with sticks and stones, we maintained a running
fight until driven into Stoke, after abandoning our
donkeys and giving up the contest. The clergyman
at Stoke (Mr. Shield) who had witnessed the
engagement, said it was the defeat of the long-eared
cavalry by the Egyptian infantry.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>When I was on board the Boreas and Conqueror
with my father I had nothing to do with the midshipmen,
as I lived in the gunroom of the former
and wardroom of the latter. But in this ship I
took my degrees (not as a doctor of Oxford, thank
God!) but as a midshipman in the cockpit of H.M.
ship Panther, with some of the best fellows that
ever graced the British navy. I joined her early in
1782 fitting in Portsmouth Harbour, commanded
by Captain Thomas Piercy of glorious memory. I
had eleven shillings given me by some friends in
Gosport, and I thought my fortune was made.</p>

<p class='c008'>On my introduction to my new shipmates I was
shown down to the starboard wing berth. I had
not been long seated before a rugged-muzzled midshipman
came in, and having eyed me for a short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>time, he sang out with a voice of thunder: ‘Blister
my tripes—where the hell did you come from? I
suppose you want to stick your grinders (for it was
near dinner-time) into some of our a la mode beef;’
and without waiting for a reply, he sat down and
sang a song that I shall remember as long as I live.
The first verse, being the most moral, I shall give:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Duchess from Germany</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Has lately made her will;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her body she’s left to be buried,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Her soul to the devil in hell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This gentleman’s name was Watson; and notwithstanding
the song and his blunt manner of
speaking, he proved to be a very good fellow, and
was the life and soul of the mess.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must now describe our starboard wing berth
and compare it with the manners and customs of
the present day. In this ship our mess-place had
canvas screens scrubbed white, wainscot tables, well
polished, Windsor chairs, and a pantry fitted in the
wing to stow our crockery and dinner traps with
safety. The holystones and hand organs,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> in requisition
twice a week, made our orlop deck as white as
the boards of any crack drawing room, the strictest
attention being paid to cleanliness; and everything
had the appearance of Spartan simplicity. We used
to sit down to a piece of salt beef, with sour krout,
and dine gloriously with our pint of black-strap<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
after, ready at all calls, and as fit for battle as for
muster. Here mark the difference. The cockpit
abandoned, and my lords and gentlemen ushered
into the gunroom fitted up in luxurious style, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>window curtains, blinds, buffets, wine coolers, silver
forks, and many other appendages of that delicate
nature, unknown in the good old times; and, if I
am correctly informed, a brass knocker<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> fixed at the
gunroom door, which ever and anon announces the
approach of the mighty members with as much
pomp as a Roman consul with his lictors thundering
at the door for admittance. But enough of this.
When war comes we shall see.</p>

<p class='c008'>When I joined the Panther, Mr. Price, the
purser, who I knew nothing of, furnished me with
everything I stood in need of, as the ship was
hurried off to join Lord Howe and I had not time
to get fitted out. When the ship was paid, he
refused to take any remuneration when I called to
repay the obligation, but said he would do the same
again with pleasure. I stand indebted to his kindness,
which I shall remember for ever with heart-felt
gratitude and respect for his memory, and
grieved I am that the service should have lost so
good an officer, lamented by every person who had
the pleasure of his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c008'>We sailed (I think) in May with the grand fleet
under Lord Howe, to cruise in the North Sea after
the Dutch. On our arrival in the Downs, Captain
Piercy, from ill health, left the ship, to the great
regret of every officer and man on board, and was
succeeded in the command by Captain Robert
Simonton.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>During our cruise the influenza carried off great
numbers in the fleet. Our ship’s company (a most
excellent one) was turned over to the Raisonnable, 64,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and that of the Ripon, 60, sent on board of us, and
we shortly after left the fleet, and returned to the
Downs to relieve the old Dromedary, and hoisted
the flag (blue at the fore) of Vice-Admiral Sir
Francis William Drake as port admiral, for about
a month; when we were relieved by the Ripon,
and then proceeded to St. Helen’s, where we remained
a short time, and sailed with a flying
squadron to the westward, consisting of four sail
of the line and three frigates, under the command
of Captain Reeve<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> as commodore, as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>About the middle of July, in the Bay of Biscay
we took, after a long chase, three prizes, the Pigmy
cutter, Hermione victualler, with ninety bullocks
for the combined fleet, and a brig laden with salt.
A day or two after, when blowing very hard and
under a close-reefed main topsail and foresail, on
the starboard tack, a fleet was seen to leeward on
the beam and lee bow. The commodore made the
private signal which was not answered, and then
the signal for an enemy and to wear and make sail
on the other tack. Wore accordingly, and set close-reefed
topsails, with fore and main tacks on board,
which worked the old ship most charmingly. In
loosing the mizen topsail, and before letting it fall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>I slipped my foot from the horse<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and fell off the
yard into the top, and saved my life by catching
hold of the clewline, having fallen from the bunt
of the sail. The captain saw this and gave me
a terrible rub down for not taking more care of
myself. One of the prizes (the brig with salt) was
retaken. The next morning, the weather being
moderate, saw the enemy about three leagues to
leeward. Sent down one of our frigates, the
Monsieur who sailed remarkably well, to reconnoitre;
in the evening they were out of sight.
Soon after, we fell in with the Sandwich, 90, Vice-Admiral
Sir Peter Parker (white at the fore), with
the Count de Grasse<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> on board a prisoner, and a
large convoy from the West Indies bound to
England. Parted company from Sir Peter. Several
ships of the line joined our squadron, which proceeded
to cruise off the coast of Ireland for a short
time, and then returned to Spithead, where we
found the grand fleet fitting for the relief of
Gibraltar. Caught fire in the marine storeroom
near the after magazine, which damaged several
knapsacks before it could be got under. We had
only one boat alongside, the others being absent
getting off the stores from the dockyard. A quartermaster’s
wife and three others jumped out of one of
the lower-deck ports into this boat, and casting off
the painter pulled away for the hospital beach as
well as any bargemen, leaving their husbands to
take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>August the 29th, one of our fleet, the Royal
George, 100, Rear-Admiral Kempenfelt (blue at the
mizen), being on a careen, to the astonishment of
every person upset at Spithead, and more than two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>thirds of her crew drowned, and among the number
that brave and meritorious officer Admiral Kempenfelt,
a man that has never been surpassed as an
able tactician. We saved twenty-seven of her
hands. One of them told a curious story. He
said he was boat-keeper of the pinnace, whose
painter was fast to the stern-ladder; and just as the
ship was going over, the hairdresser took a flying
leap out of the stern gallery with a powder bag in
his hand and had nearly jumped into his boat. He
was so much alarmed that he could not cast off the
painter, nor could he find his knife to cut it, and
was obliged to jump and swim for his life, when our
boat picked him up. His own boat went down
with the ship. It was a sad sight to see the dead
bodies floating about Spithead by scores until we
sailed. The poor admiral and several officers were
never found. Captain Waghorn (the admiral’s
captain) was saved and tried by a court martial and
acquitted. God knows who the blame ought to
light on, for blame there must have been somewhere,
for never was a ship lost in such a strange
and unaccountable manner. The ship might have
been weighed had proper steps been taken. A
stupid attempt was made, but failed, as well it
might; for neither officers nor men exerted themselves.
The Royal William and Diligente were
placed one on each side, and would have raised her,
but energy was wanting, and there she remains,
a disgrace to this day.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Lord Howe having hoisted his flag (blue at the
main) on board the Victory, 110, and the fleet being
ready, the signal was made on the 11th of September
to get under way, and that we were to take charge
of the convoy as commodore with a broad blue
pennant, and the Buffalo, 60, to bring up the rear.
The convoy consisted of fifty sail of victuallers for
the relief, with which we went through the Needles
and joined the grand fleet at the back of the Isle of
Wight, the Bristol, 50, and East India fleet under
her charge, in company. In forming the line of battle
the Goliath was to lead on the starboard tack and
the Vengeance on the larboard. The fleet consisted
of thirty-four sail of the line, besides frigates, and
their names I shall give when I come to the action
with the combined fleets.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> We had moderate
weather down Channel, and the number of convoys
collected, and under the protection of the grand
fleet to a certain distance, made up several hundred
sail, which cut a fine appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, when the fleet got well into the Bay of
Biscay, things began to alter, the wind shifting to
the SW, with heavy squalls, which increased from a
gale to a furious hurricane. I remember being at
dinner in the wardroom when the height of the gale
came on, the ship being under a close-reefed main
topsail, and a very heavy sea running, which made
her labour prodigiously. Our third lieutenant
(Montagu) came down and said: ‘Gentlemen, prepare
for bad weather; the admiral has handed his main
topsail and hove to under storm staysails. Our
main topsail was not handed ten minutes before she
gave a roll that beggared all description; ‘chaos
seemed to have come again,’ and it appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>doubtful whether she would right. The quarter deck
guns were out of sight from this lee lurch, and
the weather roll was equally terrible. The scuttle
butts<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> broke adrift and were stove; a lower-deck
gun started and with great difficulty was secured;
one of our poor fellows was lost overboard, and
serious apprehensions were entertained for the
safety of the ship, who cut such dreadful capers that
we expected she would founder. I must here
mention that when the Panther came from abroad,
the devil tempted the navy board to order her
proper masts to be taken out, and [a] fifty-gun ship’s
placed in their room, and this occasioned her to roll
so dreadfully. It was in this gale that the Ville de
Paris, Glorieux, Hector, Centaur, and others were
lost on their passage to England from the West
Indies. It lasted a considerable time, and it was
near the middle of October before the fleet entered
the Gut of Gibraltar.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>His lordship made the signal to prepare for
battle, and while he stood up the Straits with the
fleet, we were ordered to lead in the relief. In doing
so we had near been relieved for ever, for we were
taken in a sudden squall with our lower-deck guns
run out, that had nearly swamped the ship before
we could get them in and the ports down. Stood in
for the Rock, but unfortunately got black-strapped <a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>with part of the convoy, and with difficulty got them
safe into Rosia Bay. Had three cheers given us by
the garrison. The enemy’s fleet, consisting of forty-five
sail of the line, at anchor at Algesiras; one of
their ships, the St. Michael, 70, a prize to the Rock;
she had driven in the late gale under the batteries
near the Old Mole and was captured. A constant
cannonade kept up between the garrison and the
Spanish lines; shot and shells flying in every direction;
not a house left standing in the town, and the
forts that were abreast the junk ships<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a> (sunk before
we arrived) beaten down to the water’s edge; the
inhabitants living in the bomb-proof, the only place
of safety; and with the exception of the old Moorish
Tower, that bid defiance to shot and shells, everything
had the appearance of desolation and ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we remained in Rosia Bay, one of the
enemy’s line-of-battle ships (a three-decker) had the
temerity to stand in and attack us and the convoy
at anchor; but when within gunshot, the batteries
opened such a heavy fire that she was obliged to
haul off after being severely handled, doing us little
damage—we had none killed or wounded. It was
laughable to see the convoy blaze away with their
pop-guns at this great hulk of a ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have lately seen a volume [i. 106 <em>seq.</em>] of
Lieutenant Marshall’s <cite>Naval Biography</cite>, where he
mentions, in the Life of Admiral Holloway, who
commanded the Buffalo, 60, several particulars
respecting the relief. Anyone not knowing better
must suppose from reading his account that Captain
Holloway had the sole charge, when, in fact, he only
brought up the rear, and was under our orders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>No mention is made of the Panther being the commodore,
and leading in a great part of the victuallers.
Now, without wishing to take from the merits of
Captain Holloway (who was a most able officer) I
must beg leave to state that Captain Simonton, who
was intrusted with the convoy, did his duty full as
well as Captain H., although Lieutenant Marshall
takes no notice of the Panther or her commander.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same gentleman quotes an anonymous
author<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> who reflects upon Lord Howe, and, among
other incorrect statements, says it was injudicious in
his lordship to place the Buffalo the rear ship in the
action. Now I for one flatly contradict this, and I
say that the Vengeance, 74, and not the Buffalo, was
the rear ship. Lord Howe was too good an officer
to place a ship in a situation where she was likely to
be cut off, and his lordship’s character is above the
animadversions of an author who was afraid to put
his name to his work. One of the convoy under
charge of the Buffalo was captured, with the baggage
and soldiers’ wives, the only loss sustained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The enemy’s fleet having got under way on the
17th or 18th October, we also weighed; but were
obliged to anchor, the enemy having made demonstrations
to attack us. They, however, gave up the
point for fear of the batteries; and we soon after
left the Bay and joined the fleet preparing to anchor
in Tetuan Bay, until his lordship was made
acquainted of the combined fleet being at sea and
standing up the Straits. The next morning, the
19th of October, the weather ‘rather hazy, a kind of
a mizzle,’ the admiral made the signal to prepare for
battle, the wind having shifted to the eastward, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the enemy in sight. His lordship soon after made
the signal to bear up and sail large through the Gut,
it not being his intention to engage until clear of
the Straits. The enemy’s fleet stood after us with
every sail they could pack. It was a very beautiful
sight to observe the evolutions of the two fleets and
a fair trial of who could sail best. I well remember
the Victory, Edgar, Raisonnable, and Royal
William, with their topsails on the cap, running
ahead of some with topgallant sails set. Our old
ship, once called the Flying Panther, would have
out-sailed any of them, had her masts not been
altered. As we and the old Buffalo were not in the
line of battle, because we had charge of the convoy
before we saw them safe in, we imagined our station
would be with the frigates to look on and see the
fun, and we were laughing to think we should have
a cool view of a battle, and one of the officers (who
had read a little) observed he should be like Scipio
the Younger, who, when sent on a mission to Africa,
saw from an eminence a battle between that old
vagabond Masinissa and the poor Carthaginians
that lasted from morning until night. ‘But mortal
joys, alas! are fleeting;’ for behold Lord Howe made
our signal to come within hail; and while passing
under the stern of the Victory we received directions
to take our station in the line of battle between
the Ruby and the Foudroyant in the van division.
Nothing more about Scipio and Masinissa! The
Buffalo was sent to the rear between the Union, 90,
and Vengeance, 74. What do you say to that,
Lieutenant Marshall, in your <cite>Naval Biography</cite>?</p>

<p class='c008'>It took the fleet the whole day to clear the Gut.
The next morning, off Cape Spartel, the signal was
made to form the line of battle on the starboard
tack and to prepare for action; the enemy coming
down in line of battle abreast, with light winds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>every sail set, making numerous signals, which had
a very fine effect, as every ship repeated the signal
and their fleet had the appearance of being dressed
in colours. Our line was drawn up in the finest
style, and so close and correct that you could only
see the ship ahead and the other astern.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So close their order, so disposed their fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Pallas’ self might view with fixed delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or had the God of war inclined his eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>The God of war had owned a just surprise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Owing to the light winds and the enemy repeatedly
hauling up and then bearing away, it was
near 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> before he formed his line. A three-decker
(supposed to be the Royal Louis) leading his
van began the action by firing into the Goliath, who
led ours. The action continued from 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> until
¾ past 10; the van and rear chiefly engaged; the
centre had little to do. The enemy’s centre extended
to our rear-most ship, so that eleven or twelve of
them (the whole of their rear) never fired a shot.
We had four killed and sixteen wounded; among the
former Mr. Robert Sturges, midshipman doing duty
as mate, a gentleman highly respected and lamented
by every officer and man on board. I was placed
with another youngster under his care, and he took
the greatest pains to teach us our duty. He was
as brave a fellow as ever lived, and when his thigh
was nearly shot off by the hip, he cheered the men
when dying. It was a spent shot that killed him,
and weighed 28 pounds; and what was remarkable,
it took off at the same time the leg of a pig in the
sty under the forecastle.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I had a very narrow escape while standing on
the quarter deck with Captain Forrester of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>marines. The first lieutenant (the late Admiral
Alexander Fraser) came up to us, and while speaking
a shot passed between us and stuck on the larboard
side of the quarter deck. We were very close at the
time, so that it could only have been a few inches
from us. It knocked the speaking trumpet out of
Fraser’s hand, and seemed to have electrified Captain
Forrester and myself. The shot was cut out and
weighed either 12 or 18 pounds—I forget which.
Our rigging fore and aft was cut to pieces; the booms
and boats also, and every timber head on the forecastle,
with the sheet and spare anchor stocks, were
shot away, and the fluke of the latter. Our side,
from the foremost gun to the after, was like a riddle,
and it was astonishing that we had not more killed
and wounded. Several shot-holes were under water,
and our worthy old carpenter (Mr. Cock) had very
near been killed in the wing, and was knocked down
by a splinter, but not materially hurt. The enemy
set off in the night and could only be seen from the
masthead in the morning. It was supposed they
went for Cadiz.</p>

<p class='c008'>A curious circumstance took place during the
action. Two of the boys who had gone down for
powder fell out in consequence of one attempting
to take the box from the other, when a regular
fight took place. It was laughable to see them
boxing on the larboard side, and the ship in hot
action on the starboard. One of our poor fellows
was cut in two by a double-headed shot on the
main deck, and the lining of his stomach (about
the size of a pancake) stuck on the side of the
launch, which was stowed amidships on the main
deck with the sheep inside.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The butcher who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the care of them, observing what was on the side
of the boat, began to scrape it off with his nails,
saying, ‘Who the devil would have thought the
fellow’s paunch would have stuck so? I’m damned
if I don’t think it’s glued on!’</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a fellow by the name of Mulligan who
ran from his quarters and positively hid in the
coppers! and had put on the drummer’s jacket.
When the firing had ceased he was seen coming
out, and was taken for the poor drummer, and ran
forward taking off the jacket, which he hid in the
round house; but one of the boatswain’s mates
observed the transaction and Mr. Mulligan got well
flogged just as the action was over. The poor
drummer had greatly distinguished himself, and had
taken off his jacket in the heat of the action, which
this fellow stole to hide his rascality.</p>

<p class='c016'>[Lists of the fleet, killed and wounded, of detachments
to the West Indies and the coast of Ireland, follow. They
are in close agreement with the lists given by Schomberg
(<cite>Naval Chronology</cite>, iv. 390 <em>seq.</em>) and were probably copied
from them, or the published lists which Schomberg reproduced.
In any case, they have no special authority and
are therefore omitted.</p>

<p class='c025'>In November, on the Panther’s arriving at Plymouth,
where Vice-Admiral Lord Shuldham had his flag in the
Dunkirk—]</p>

<p class='c007'>a court martial was held on board the Dunkirk
on one of our midshipmen (Mr. Foularton) on
some trifling charge brought against him by Lieutenant
Hanwell of the Dublin, on which he was
fully acquitted. One of our main-top men (Martin
Anguin), in sending down the topgallant mast, fell
from the fore part of the main topmast crosstrees
and pitched on the collar of the main stay, from
which he went down, astern of the barge upon the
booms, into the hold, the gratings being off. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>was sent to the hospital without a fractured limb,
but much bruised about the breast. He recovered
and came on board to receive his pay on the day the
ship was paid off. Such a fall and to escape with
life, I believe is not to be found in the annals of
naval history.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Hoisted the flag (blue at the fore)
of Vice-Admiral Milbanke as port admiral, second in
command.</p>

<p class='c008'>The peace soon after taking place, a mutiny
broke out in the men of war, and some of the ships
began to unrig without orders, and were in a high
state of insubordination, particularly the Blenheim,
Crown, Standard, Medway, and Artois. I do not remember
that any examples were made, but this I am
sure of, that the ringleaders richly deserved hanging.
Having received orders we dismantled the ship
and struck Admiral Milbanke’s flag, and in a few
days after the old Panther was paid off to the great
regret of every officer on board. It was like the
parting of a family who had lived long together in
the strictest friendship; and while writing this, it
brings to mind many circumstances that make me
bitterly lament the inroads death has made among
those worthy fellows.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The stroke of fate the bravest cannot shun:</div>
      <div class='line'>The great Alcides, Jove’s unequall’d son,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Juno’s hate at length resigned his breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before closing my account of the Panther, I must
relate a few anecdotes that happened during the
time I belonged to her. I was placed with another
youngster, by the name of Owen, under the tuition
of the captains of the fore and main top. We were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>both in the same watch, which we kept first in one top
and then in the other, to learn to knot and splice and
to reef a sail; and for their attention we remunerated
them with our grog. I remember the captain of the
fore top (Joe Moulding), a very droll fellow, teaching
us what he called a catechism, which we were obliged
to repeat to him at two bells in every middle watch.
It was as follows:</p>

<p class='c026'>‘So fine the Conflustions!! of old Mother
Damnable, who jumped off the fore topsail
yard and filled the main topgallant sail; run
down the lee leach of the mizen and hauled
the main tack on board, that all the devils
in hell could not raise it; clapped a sheepshank
on the main mast, a bowline knot on
the foremast, and an overhand knot on the
mizen mast; run the keel athwart ships,
coiled the cables in the binnacle, tossed
the quarter deck overboard, and made a
snug ship for that night; when up jumped
the little boy Fraser with a handspike
stuck in his jaws to fend the seas off, with
which he beat them into peas porridge,
and happy was the man who had the
longest spoon. AMEN!!’<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After repeating this rigmarole we were obliged
to start up to the mast head, if topgallant yards were
across, to blow the dust out of the topgallant clueline
blocks. One night, blowing and raining like the
devil, I proposed to Owen about five bells in the
middle watch to steal down out of the top and take
the raisins that were intended for the pudding next
day. When we got down to our berth we found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>raisins were mixed with the flour and we had the
devil’s own job to pick them out. After filling our
pockets, one of the watch came down for grog and
found us out. We ran off as fast as we could and
got in the weather main rigging, where poor Owen
was caught, seized up and made a spread eagle of
for the remainder of the watch and part of the next.
I made my escape and remained some time on the
collar of the main stay, until all was quiet. One of
the watch came up, but not finding me in the top
gave over chase; but I got cobbed in the morning,
and no pudding for dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>While in Hamoaze we had a draught of Irish
Volunteers, about sixty in number. One of them
was seven feet high, and when the hands were turned
up to muster on the quarter deck, he stood like
Saul the King of Israel, with head and shoulders
above the host. This man used to head his countrymen
when on shore upon leave, and was the terror
of the people about Dock,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> particularly North Corner
Street, flourishing an Irish shillelah of enormous size,
[so] that the constables when called out would fly like
chaff at the very sight of him. He was, like the
rest of his countrymen, honest and brave, and very
inoffensive, but woe betide those that insulted him.
Being in the dockyard returning stores, some of the
shipwrights called him a walking flagstaff; for
which compliment he gave two or three of them a
terrible beating, and then challenged to fight twelve
of the best men among them, taking two a day, but
the challenge was not accepted from so queer a
customer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night before we were paid off our ship’s
company gave a grand supper and the lower deck
was illuminated. Several female visitors were of the
party from Castlerag and other fashionable places,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>who danced jigs and reels the whole of the night,
with plenty of grog and flip; and what was remarkable,
not a soul was drunk in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here mention that my shipmates, though
brave as lions, were given to superstition, as the
following will show. After poor Sturges was killed
it was given out that he was often seen in the tier, and
sometimes in the cockpit. This had such an effect
that not one of the midshipmen would stay below
by himself. I remember one of them (Sm.
Simmonds) falling asleep on the table in the starboard
wing berth; and the rest going on deck, he
was left alone. When he awoke, he took to his
heels and ran up to the gunroom, where he fainted
away and remained so a long time. When he came
to, he declared that he saw poor Sturges standing in
the berth as pale as death and looking steadfastly at
him. This story worked so much upon the minds
of the others that they took good care to have
company at all times when left below. I had the
shot that killed my worthy friend, and intended to
have brought it home; but by some means it was
lost or stolen on the morning of pay day.</p>

<p class='c008'>While lying in Hamoaze our midshipmen carried
on a roaring trade when rowing guard in the middle
watch. They would sometimes set off to Catwater
to visit a house where a very handsome girl lived,
who would get up at any hour to make flip for them
and felt highly flattered at their calling her Black-eyed
Susan. I have sometimes been of the party
and well recollect the many escapes we have had
in carrying sail to get back in time, as the passage
from Catwater to Hamoaze is rather a rough one
in blowing weather, and the boat would frequently
be gunwale under, so that I often thought my life
was at stake.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should have mentioned that our ship’s company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>mutinied as well as the other ships,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and some of our
midshipmen that were obnoxious went on shore
before the ship was paid off. A gentleman whose
name I shall not give, and who had joined us in
Hamoaze, had unluckily given some umbrage to the
men, and was one of those who kept out of the way;
but after the ship was paid off some of the fellows
met him at the bottom of North Corner Street and
took him on board of a collier and gave him a
ducking.</p>

<p class='c008'>After leaving the old Panther several of the
officers were put on board the Rose transport for a
passage to Portsmouth; but the wind being unfavourable
for more than a fortnight, we left the
Rose and her mutinous lot of scoundrels, she being
ordered somewhere else. We were then transferred
to the Hope transport, and after considerable delay
we sailed for Portsmouth with a fine breeze from the
westward, which soon after changed to the eastward,
and blew like the devil. We were nine days turning
up Channel<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>; however, we had a glorious set on board,
and the master of the vessel (whose name I forget)
did everything in the most handsome manner to make
us comfortable. On the tenth day we arrived
at Spithead, and on my landing at Gosport I found
my poor grandmother at the point of death. She
wished much to see me before she died. I followed
her to the grave where she was interred alongside of
my grandfather, Captain James Gardner, Royal
Navy.</p>

<p class='c008'>If I remember correctly it was this year that an
extraordinary court martial was held on the master
of the Proselyte for cutting the lanyards of the
weather main shrouds when the people were up
reefing topsails. The charge not being proved, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was acquitted. While laying in the harbour, a
French frigate with a commodore came in, saluted
the admiral, and remained a few days. The 28th
October is the time for the men of war to sail
for England; but owing to unfavourable winds, we
were not able to leave St. John’s before November.
The admiral having given permission for any
person that pleased to take home a dog, 75 were
actually embarked. We took our departure with a
sloop of war in company. I am not certain whether
it was this year or the next, when about 60 leagues
to the SW of Scilly we were covered in the night
with a flock of crows and caught several. When
near the Channel we fell in with a vessel from the
coast of Africa in want of provisions, the crew living
on parrots and monkeys, and in great distress;
supplied them with provisions and parted company,
and after a passage of near three weeks arrived at
Spithead, and then into harbour, where we remained
as a half-and-half guard-ship until May, when the
admiral hoisted his flag, and we soon after sailed
for our station, in company with a sloop of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>When on the banks of Newfoundland, in a thick
fog at night, going about three knots, a field of ice
struck us on the weather bow and carried away the
starboard bumpkin and head sails, besides knocking
off several sheets of copper. On the banks we
picked up a cask of brandy covered with weeds and
barnacles, and saw the yards and spars of the line-of-battle
ships that were lost on and near the banks
in the gale of September 1782 on their passage to
England from the West Indies. Fell in with
several islands of ice. Arrived at St. John’s, and
remained there the usual time. We had a brewery
on shore which supplied the squadron with spruce
beer.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a> I was on shore at this brewery when one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>our men unfortunately fell into the boiling coppers
and died the same day in a most deplorable condition.
It was said that the beer was sent off (of
course by mistake) to the squadron, and I think some
little demur was made about drinking it and it was
sent back.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 29th of October (1785) we left St. John’s
with a thundering gale right aft. A merchant who
had never been out of St. John’s harbour took a
passage for England. We had a tremendous sea
following that almost turned his brain with horror.
One sea that measured heights with the mizen peak
had a prodigious effect upon him, and with a look I
cannot describe, he called out, ‘Lord, Lord, Lord,
Have mercy on me, and pray do let go the anchor!’
His bawling out so horribly, frightened the man at
the wheel so that the ship was in danger of broaching
to. This gale lashed us on at a devil of a rate,
and we had 294 and 296 knots on the log in 24
hours. Our passage was very short as far as the
Lizard, when the wind shifted to the eastward, and
I think it was nineteen days before we arrived at
Spithead, having a dish of turnips<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> all the way up
Channel. Went into Portsmouth harbour, where
the old Salisbury was paid off the latter end of 1785
or beginning of 1786.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the most hateful and disagreeable ship
I ever had my foot on board of—so unlike the
Panther. Mastheading upon every trifling occasion.
The senior midshipmen (with the exception of a few)
were tyrants; and petty tyrants are generally the
worst. The captain was a very good man at
times, but often harsh and severe in his remarks.
He once told me (and I have never forgotten it) I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>would never be fit for anything but the boatswain’s
storeroom. This was because I was down with the
keys in my turn, a midshipman being always sent to
see that lights are not taken into the storeroom
except in a lantern, which is the custom in every
man of war. He had missed me in the watch and
thought I was skulking; and though I explained to
him how it happened, it was all to no purpose.
Great men don’t like to be put right. I well remember
the cutting taunt; but I thank God his
prophecy did not come to pass, as the certificates I
am proud to say I produced from some of the first
officers in the service will testify; and when I went
to pass for lieutenant at Somerset House, the commissioners
told me my certificates would get me promoted
without interest. Upon this hint I transmitted
them to Earl Spencer, the first lord of the
admiralty, and by return of post he gave me a commission
and appointed me second lieutenant of the
Hind, 28. This may be considered as sounding my
own trumpet. It may be so; but it is the truth.
Enough of this digression, and let me return to the
old bundle of boards and relate a few circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have positively, after keeping the first watch
while in the harbour of St. John’s, been turned out
with other youngsters, to keep the morning watch
and most of the forenoon without being relieved.
Had we complained we knew what we had to expect
from the overgrown tyrants, some of whom were
members of the Hell-fire Club. I remember my
old messmate, Ben Morgan (poor fellow! now dead
and gone), having the lower part of his ear detached
from his head because he kicked a little at the
tyranny.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our admiral was a great astronomer and took
delight in lunar observation. One Sunday morning
he sent four of us down with Pye the schoolmaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to work a lunar. While we were below, the hands
were turned up to muster, and we were going to
attend, but Pye said there was no occasion.
Presently down came the quartermaster saying
Lieutenant Stiles (who had the watch) wanted us.
On going up he, in a very knowing way, demanded
why we were not up to muster, and on our acquainting
him with the reason he said it was all very well,
and it would be better if we were to step up to the
masthead and look out for squalls, as it was too
thick to take a lunar. So two of us (I was one)
were sent to the main topmast head and two to the
fore, where we remained some hours. This was on
the banks; a thick fog having just come on, with
drops from the topgallant rigging which wetted us
through in a short time; but that was of no consideration.
On another trifling occasion, the same
worthy was going to trice me up to the mizen peak,
but this he thought better of. I could relate many
more cases, but let this be sufficient. Lieutenant
Stiles lately died a rear-admiral. One of the laws
of Solon says, ‘Speak not ill of the dead; no, not if
their sons offend you.’ I shall attend to this and
say no more on the subject until I come to the
Edgar, and then naught in malice.</p>

<p class='c008'>When at St. Johns, a playhouse was got up by
Graham, the admiral’s secretary, with considerable
ability, and several of the officers used to perform.
The scenery was very good and did Mr. Graham
a deal of credit. Only the favoured few could get
leave to see the performance. The kindhearted first
lieutenant would send us that were not descended
from the Kings of Cappadocia and Pontus on
board at sunset, for fear we should catch cold if we
stayed out late. This was making game; and I
remember some of us meeting the admiral, who
kindly gave us leave to pick fruit in his gardens for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>two hours, when this same Lieutenant Deacon
happened to come up at the time; and when the
admiral was gone, he started us on board, when we
had not been there a quarter of an hour, saying he
was fearful the fruit would gripe us. Kind soul!—the
devil thank him. He was a most facetious gentleman,
and when a seaman once asked him for slops,
he replied, ‘Certainly, my man, what slops do you
want?’ ‘A jacket, sir, if you please.’ ‘And cannot
you think of something else?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ says the
man, ‘I will be glad of a shirt and trowsers.’ ‘Very
well, you shall have them. But do think of something
more that you stand in need of,’ ‘Why, sir,’
says the man, ‘If you have no objection I should like
a pair of shoes and stockings, and a smock frock.’<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
‘Very well, my man, you shall have them all in good
time. I expect a vessel in with some blue chalk
from the Straits of Baffleman, and then I shall chalk
out all your wants; so be off, or I shall get the
boatswain’s mate to measure you with the end of the
fore brace before her arrival, which you may think
rather premature.’</p>

<p class='c008'>When asking him for leave to go on shore he
would frequently say, ‘As soon as I have time to
chalk you out a barge to take you, I shall attend to
this most important business.’ Once on a rainy day
he was making some of those remarks, when his foot
slipped and he fell on his bottom on the quarter
deck. One of the lieutenants said, ‘Had the deck
been chalked, sir, it would have saved your fall.’
This vexed him greatly, and seeing us laugh he
started us up to the masthead for the remainder of
the watch, saying, ‘Take care! As the rigging is not
chalked you may slip and get an ugly fall.’</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already mentioned our bringing home 75
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>dogs. I messed in the main hatchway berth on the
lower deck, with four midshipmen and a scribe.
We had eight of those dogs billeted on us. One of
them had the name of Thunder. At dinner I once
gave him a piece of beef with plenty of mustard
rolled up in it. The moment he tasted it, he flew
at me and I was obliged to run for it. He never
forgot it, and whenever I offered him victuals he
would snap at me directly. Another of those dogs
used to sleep at the foot of Charley Bisset’s cot, and
when the quartermaster would call the watch this
dog would fly at him if he came near Bisset, who
would often plead ignorance of being called, and by
that means escape going on deck for the first hour
of the watch. We had a drunken Irishman, by the
name of Collins, who, when sent to the hospital at
St. John’s, contrived to get liquor in spite of all
precaution to prevent it. At last it was found out
by the following circumstance. He had one of
those dogs that could do anything but speak. He
used to sling a bottle round his neck and then put a
shilling in his mouth and send him off in the evening.
The dog knew well where to go, for he had been
often there with Collins. It was to a public-house,
between the hospital and St. John’s. He’d howl as
soon as he got there; the landlord knew well what
he wanted, and would fill the bottle with rum. The
dog would then drop the shilling, but not before, and
scamper off to return to his master; not at the gate
of the hospital—he was too cunning for that—but
like a Roman conqueror, through a hole in the wall;
when one night he was discovered by the watch
going their rounds, and by that means the business
was brought to light. From the ingenuity of the
master and his dog, both escaped punishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our armourer was a man who would drink like
a fish, and one morning coming to the brewery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>complaining of thirst, the cooper, a droll and wicked
fellow, gave him some essence of spruce, and the
armourer took a good swig before he found out his
mistake. The moment he could speak he asked
what it was he had taken. The cooper said he was
very sorry for what had happened, but he thought it
right to acquaint him it was some stuff they had to
poison rats. The armourer was struck dumb with
terror, but at last, in a paroxysm of rage, swore that
the cooper should die first; and drawing out a large
knife, gave chase and certainly would have put an
end to his joking had he not locked himself up in
the brewery in great tribulation, as the armourer
was trying all in his power to break open the door.
However, the poor fellow was at last made sensible
it was a joke, and had some double spruce given him
to make amends—which had the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our second assistant surgeon was another wet
soul, and coming from the play half drunk went to
sleep in an empty cask that was lying on Quigley’s
Wharf, when a squall of wind rolled the cask overboard
and poor old Andrew Reardon would have
been drowned, had it not been for the boat-keeper
of the cutter. Old Andrew is now dead. He
dearly loved grog, and when told that new rum was
a bad article he said he didn’t care; if it fractured
the brain it was all he wanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a few exceptions we had a terrible lot of
wild midshipmen. Some of them were members of
the Hell-fire Club,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and used to dress, when going to
that place, in scarlet coats with black velvet collars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and cuffs, black waistcoat, breeches, and stockings,
and hair powdered. Those chaps would play all
manner of wicked pranks on board, such as pouring
molasses under the heads of those who slept in the
tier, and others would have a hook and line with
which they’d haul our quilts and blankets off in the
night, and then heave water over us, at the same
time making a squeaking noise; while others, in the
secret, would say it was the gibbering of a ghost,
and that the tier was haunted; but that they would
ask the parson (a wet soul) to lay the spirit, not in
the Red Sea, but in the large pond near St. Johns.
One poor fellow, a clerk whose name was Newnham,
but nicknamed Newcome, they got in the tier one
night in the dark, and swore it was the admiral’s cow
that had got adrift. It was no use for the poor
fellow to say he was not that personage; for a
selvagee was clapped round him in an instant with a
hauling line made fast, with which they roused him
up the hatchway in a moment, terrified almost to
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here mention the shifts my old messmate,
Ben Morgan, and myself were put to the last year
we were at St. John’s. Our captain used to pay our
mess and washing bills, for which he was repaid on
our return to England. It happened one morning
when the washing bill was sent in, that he observed
our towels were inserted with other articles; upon
which he sent for us, and after a severe reprimand
upon our extravagance, adding that we ought to
have washed the towels ourselves, he dismissed us,
saying he should give no more money to be fooled
away in that manner, and that we deserved to be
well flogged in the bargain. We were glad enough
to steer clear of him. In respect of the money he
was as good as his word; for devil a farthing more
would he let us have, and we were sadly put to it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>for we had only Tom Cod (caught alongside) for
breakfast, salt beef or pork for dinner, and Tom Cod
for tea in the evening. At last we in some measure
got over our difficulties by going to the hills and
gathering a weed called maidenhair, a good substitute
for tea; and with molasses instead of sugar,
poor Ben and myself fared gloriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>While at St. John’s two of our seamen deserted
and got into the woods on their way to an out port;
and they had nearly been devoured by the wolves
who attacked them in a hut, where they remained
three days without provisions, and had great difficulty
and danger in coming back to the ship, where
they were treated with two dozen apiece.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our captain to keep us in good order placed a
Mr. Stack as father of our mess. He was cursed
surly and disagreeable, but I believe meant well;
only [he had] an ugly way of showing his kindness.
When in good temper (which was seldom) he would
say ‘My son,’ when he addressed any of us; but
generally, ‘I’ll split your ear.’ This man drew a very
long bow and would frequently tell the most unaccountable
stories. I have heard him relate that
the ghost of Commodore Walsingham<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> (who he had
served under, and who was lost in the Thunderer,
74, in the West Indies, in the hurricane of 1780)
appeared to him when he was a slave on the coast
of Barbary, where he was chained by the leg for
upwards of a twelvemonth, and after undergoing
innumerable hardships he was released by a Moorish
lady who fell in love with him and paid his ransom
to a considerable amount. This was too much to
swallow from a fellow as ugly as the old Diligente’s
[figure-] head.</p>

<p class='c008'>When at Spithead and in the harbour, our ship’s
company had a violent quarrel with the crew of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Grampus 50, commanded by Ned Thompson<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> the
poet, who had the Coast of Guinea station, and
several battles were fought with various success.
The quarrel originated in some of our fellows saying
they of the Grampus, when on the coast, lived
chiefly on monkey soup, except on Sundays, and
then they were regaled on roast parrots. For this
they swore to murder every snow-eating son of a
bitch belonging to the Salisbury whenever they
could catch them. One of the mates of the Grampus
had the impudence, while we were in harbour, to
drop under our bows with a launch-load of his people
who had been for stores to the dockyard, and
challenge ours to fight; for which he had very near
been brought to a court martial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our quarrelsome blades had another row with
the riggers; and when the latter would pass the
ship in their launches, our fellows would thrust
their heads out of the ports and sing out—‘I say,
Mortimer, drop in the launch, make fast a hawser
to the NW buoy, take three round turns and a
half hitch, seize the end back and come on board
with the launch.’ This occasioned many a battle,
and the riggers generally got the worst of it; for
we had some from that land which produces the
finest peasantry in the world on board, and woe
betide those who came in contact with them. We
had the O’Ryans, the O’Gallaghers, the Macartys,
the O’Donovans, the Murphys, the O’Flahertys,
the O’Tooles and the O’Flanagans, and great part
of the ship’s company were Irish and very quiet
when not disturbed. One of those fellows—Darby
Collins, who had the dog that I have mentioned at
the hospital—did positively beat at the back of the
Point, Portsmouth, eleven men by cracking their
heads at single-stick one after the other. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>a tall, raw-boned Irishman, a Garry-owen boy that
stood up manfully for the honour of his country.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ORESTES, 18.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I joined the son of Agamemnon early in 1786,
fitting in Portsmouth Harbour for Channel service,
to cruise after smugglers from Dunnose to the
Start; Manley Dixon, Esq., commander.</p>

<p class='c008'>This brig was considered the finest in the service.
She measured 32 ft. 9 in. on the beam, and drew
17 ft. 4 in. abaft, 13 ft. 4 in. forward, and [was]
nearly 450 tons, mounting 18 long nines, and
pierced for 26. She and the Pylades (called the
Hercules and Mars) were taken from the Dutch by
Macbride in the Artois, 44.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> She sailed remarkably
well, but was a wet soul, shipping seas over the
bows and washing the men at the wheel. She
would never condescend to rise to a sea, but dash
right through. After a few cruises, when off the
Isle of Purbeck we observed two large Hogboats<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
among the rocks, and several people on horseback
upon the cliffs above the spot. Sent our boats to
examine, and found them to be smugglers with
seven hundred tubs of liquor, which we seized, and
landed the smugglers at Swanage. After landing
our tubs at the Custom House, Portsmouth, we
anchored at Yarmouth, in the Isle of Wight, our
place of rendezvous, where we remained a short
time, and then resumed our cruising; sometimes in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>company with the Hebe, 36, on the same station;
and then put into Guernsey, where we stayed but a
short time and ran out in a gale of wind. Caught
fire in the master’s cabin over the magazine, by the
candles rolling against his curtains. It created
great alarm, but was soon got under. During the
time, it occasioned the utmost terrors among the
ship’s company. Several of them got into the
forechains, the head, and on the bowsprit, ready to
jump overboard. However, they seemed to have
as much dread of water as they had of the fire and
remained stationary. It was ludicrous to see the
captain with a speaking trumpet, exerting himself
to keep order, and the carpenter’s wife catching
him round the legs, and while he was calling for
Water, she was screaming out Fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>When our cruise was over we returned to
Yarmouth, where our surgeon turned mad and cut
some unaccountable capers. One morning early,
he came upon deck and gave some orders to the
officers of the watch, who paid no attention to them.
Upon this he got hold of a crow<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> that was in the
becket over one of the guns, and began to run a-muck,<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
and cleared the deck in a moment. Sentries
and all took to their heels, and it was some time
before an opportunity offered to get him below.
At last he was got to his cabin in the gunroom,
with four marines and a midshipman to guard him;
but he soon made a start from his den and made no
more of the marines than if they were sparrows.
He first caught hold of two and knocked their
heads together, and then punished the others, who
from fear, made little resistance. He next attacked
Patterson, the master, and swore he should stand
auctioneer as it was his intention to sell his effects.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I never saw a more ludicrous scene when the
master, to humour him, began to put his things up
to auction and we, outside (for we were afraid to go
in) the gunroom, bidding for them. After the sale
was over, he made Patterson put on two of his
coats—one of them the Windsor uniform<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a>—and then
upset him and rolled him about the gunroom,
swearing he was a beer cask. Then rushing out,
he belaboured all that he met with, and went upon
deck and remained cock of the walk until he came
down of his own accord, and went to bed, saying,
‘You shall hear from me presently.’ However,
good care was taken to secure him, and he was
soon after sent to sick quarters, being a dangerous
subject, and glad enough we were to get rid of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was at Yarmouth a truly hospitable
gentleman, a Captain Urry<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> of the Royal Navy, well
known to officers in the service, who kept open
house and gave large parties. He was the life and
soul of Yarmouth, which place has never been worth
going to since his death. On one of these parties,
our barge (for we had a barge) was ordered to
attend and tow a sloop full of company (it being
calm) from Yarmouth to Lymington, and I was the
midshipman sent, and had directions to land them,
and to take orders from a captain in the navy, who
was one of the party. This being done, a half-guinea
was given to the men to drink, and I was
desired to let them go on shore for that purpose.
After they had their grog I missed the strokesman
of the barge, a tall Irishman named McCarthy, who
was nowhere to be found; in fact he had deserted.
On my return I reported this to Lieutenant Jeynes
who abused me and said he would write against me
to the captain (who lived on shore) for suffering this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>tall Paddy to run away. The next morning he was
as good as his word, and sent me with the letter.
The captain, on reading it, gave me a severe reprimand,
and sent me on board in a hurry, saying
I should hear more of it very shortly. In a day or
two after he came on board and we left Yarmouth
for Spithead. I was in hourly expectation of some
terrible explosion, as my friend the lieutenant was
constantly reminding me of the subject. After the
ship was moored the captain went on shore, and
Jeynes soon followed. The master being commanding
officer, I asked him permission to go and see
my friends, which he granted, and I never joined
the Orestes after.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was but a youngster then. Had I known as
much as I did soon after, I would have demanded a
court martial on myself, and would have brought
Lieutenant Jeynes to another for tyranny and
oppression, which he was guilty of in many instances
and had laid himself open to anyone who might
think proper to bring the charges forward. He was
obliged to leave the Orestes soon after. He had
formerly (as I have understood) been a purser, and
was broken by court martial; but having served his
time as midshipman, got to be made a lieutenant,
and died a retired commander.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever the Orestes came in I used to keep
out of the way. I lived at Gosport and was always
on the watch, and when she came into Spithead
I had timely notice and would set off for the country.
After returning from one of those excursions, I was
hiding behind a screen in our parlour; on the other
side sitting by the fire was an old schoolfellow of
mine and a young lady in earnest conversation
about me. The former among other remarks said
he believed I had made away with myself. This
observation I could not brook, and catching hold of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>a large family Bible that was on a table near me
(and which I have at this moment) I hove it over
the screen and hit my friend on the jaw and knocked
him down as flat as a flounder. I set off as fast as
I could, leaving them in the utmost consternation;
and he told me a long time after that he thought it
was the devil that had felled him, until he saw the
Bible. Captain Dixon, I believe, was aware that
Lieutenant Jeynes had blamed me wrongfully, as he
sent me my prize money and gave me a good certificate,
and offered to take me again, for which he has my
most grateful thanks, and I hope to live to see him
admiral of the fleet.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>He was a very smart officer, and did everything
in his power to teach the midshipmen their duty.
We used to take helm and lead, and reef the main
topsail; also pull in the boats upon particular
occasions, such as going along shore in the night
after smugglers, &#38;c. When we were at Guernsey,
the captain in the kindest manner allowed the petty
officers a moderate quantity of liquor in each of
their messes; but the sergeant of marines, not content
with this indulgence, smuggled twenty kegs
into the ship. When this was told the captain, he
ordered all the kegs to be brought on deck and
stove. The sergeant stood, like Niobe, in tears for
his loss. It was a most laughable sight, as the
liquor was running out mixed with salt water (for
the ship rolled a great deal), to see the fellows
laying down like beasts on the deck and licking up,
while the boatswain’s mates were thrashing them to
no purpose. The sergeant, I believe, was reduced
to the ranks.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall mention a few strange fellows we had on
board, and first Mr. Quinton the mate. This
gentleman was a good sailor, and was very fond of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>gin grog, and used to say it agreed with him so well
and made his flesh so firm. It was determined one
day to count how many glasses he drank from
morning until evening; and, if I remember correctly,
twenty-six tumblers of good Hollands and water
made the number; for in the good old times we
never sported Cockney gin. I must in justice
declare that Mr. Quinton was no drunkard; I never
saw him disguised with liquor the whole time I belonged
to the ship. The next was Mr. Stevens,
who went by the nickname of Tommy Bowline, a
rough knot; full of wise saws and strange dry sayings,
but rather slack in his movements, and was
what we call a hard officer and droll middy. When
belonging to a guard-ship commanded by Sir Roger
Curtis, while lying at Spithead the mizen topsail
was ordered to be loosed, to swing the ship the right
way. Tommy Bowline was the first to go aloft and
was highly complimented by Sir Roger for his
activity, saying ‘You are a fine fellow, Mr. Stevens;
a most active officer, Mr. Stevens; you are a wonder,
Mr. Stevens.’ Now it unfortunately happened that
Tommy was left behind by the other midshipmen
and was last on the yard. Sir Roger observing this
called out ‘I recall all my compliments, Mr. Stevens;
you are a damned lubber, Mr. Stevens; a blockhead,
Mr. Stevens; come down, Mr. Stevens.’ This
poor Tommy never heard the last of.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our gunner (McKinnon) was another strange
hand. He was troubled with sore eyes and would
sit in his cabin damning them from morning till
night. Two of our men having deserted while in
Yarmouth Roads, our boat, manned by midshipmen
with Lieutenant Jeynes, left the ship in the evening
and pulled for Cowes, where we arrived about
eleven at night. Mr. Jeynes having received some
information respecting the deserters, set off in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>boat for Ryde, leaving me at Cowes with two
marines to go round by land and meet him there.
I had no money to get any refreshment, and never
shall I forget the fatigue I went through that night.
After pulling in the boat thirteen miles, I had to
walk seven miles on a wild goose chase, for we
never heard anything more of the runaways; and the
wind shifting, we had to pull all the way back to
Yarmouth. Before I close my account of the
Orestes, I must say a word or two respecting Lieutenant
Jeynes (letting the law of Solon sleep for a
day). He was without exception the most cold-blooded
and bad fellow I ever met with. I have
seen him thrash the men with the end of a rope
in the most unfeeling manner, until he was tired,
making use of the most abusive language; and for
his tyranny was obliged to quit the ship; but, to
give the devil his due, [he] was what we call a bit of
a sailor, and if he pleased (which was seldom) could
make himself agreeable. In the year 1793, the
Orestes was lost in the Indian Seas and every soul
perished.</p>

<p class='c017'>Early in 1787 I joined the Edgar, a guard-ship in
Portsmouth Harbour—Charles Thompson, Esq.,
captain, formerly of the Boreas; and soon after
went to Spithead and hoisted the broad pennant of
the Honorable John Leveson Gower as commodore
of the squadron of observation; but the Dutch
armament taking place prevented their sailing.
Several ships of the line assembled at Spithead,
and others fitting in the harbour; but to no purpose,
as the business was soon settled, and the ships
returned to their stations, and those fitting were
paid off. Next spring we were again ordered to
Spithead, and a promotion of flags having taken
place, we hoisted the flag (blue at the mizen) of
Rear-Admiral the Hon. John Leveson Gower,
as commander-in-chief of the fleet of observation,
consisting of the following men of war:</p>

<p class='c008'>Sailed with the squadron to the westward of
Scilly, and off the Irish coast for nearly two months,
putting in occasionally to Cawsand Bay and Torbay,
and then returned to our station as guard-ship on
Portsmouth Harbour. We were very glad to get
rid of our admiral. He was what we call a tight
hand of the watch; one that would make a fellow
jump where there was no stile. He used to play
hell and turn up Jack, and would spare nobody.
He had an ugly trick of getting up as early as three
and sometimes before it in the morning, and would
walk the quarter deck in a flannel jacket, and most
of the time without a hat, until breakfast was ready;
a happy dog of a midshipman walking between two
of the quarter deck guns with a signal book, which
ever and anon he would call for in the voice of
Stentor—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose throat surpassed the force of fifty tongues.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Coming out of his cabin early one morning in
a great hurry, he fell over a signal lantern, and was
going to play hell with the lieutenant of the watch
for having lanterns upon deck at that time of day—about
half-past two in the morning. The Crown
being out of her station, he was going to make the
signal for an officer from that ship, and going to the
office to write the order he could not get in, the
clerk having the key; which put him into such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>a rage that he swore he would flog the clerk and
those that wrote under him. However, his rage
abated and he did not make the signal, it blowing
very hard; but he would not suffer the clerk or his
under-scribes to show themselves in the office while
his flag was flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Culverhouse was at this time signal lieutenant
and was not so quick in getting up this unlucky
morning as the admiral, although a very active and
able officer. The admiral, not seeing him, roared
out to me (which made me jump a foot off the deck)
‘Where’s that little son of a bitch? Go down for
him directly.’ Down I went to the gunroom where
Culverhouse slept, and told him the news. In
great tribulation he instantly got up and came upon
deck, and kept some time behind the admiral thinking
to weather the storm; but the moment he got
sight of him he sang out like a lion, ‘Go on the poop
and be damned to you. Why were you not out of
your nest before?’ I must here state that, notwithstanding
this, the admiral was a great friend to
Lieutenant Culverhouse, and I have been told first
took notice of him from the following circumstance.
When on board the Victory, he was on the gangway
with his glass, sitting on the weather clue of
the mainsail, when the main tack suddenly gave
way and threw him into the lee clue of the sail
unhurt. He was an excellent signal officer, a good
sailor, an agreeable messmate, and in every respect
a very clever fellow. He was made a post captain,
but was unfortunately drowned at the Cape of Good
Hope.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The admiral was like Sylla the Dictator;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>that is, he would go any length to serve his friends,
but was the reverse to those he had a dislike to.
He appeared to be well acquainted with the
character of most of the officers in the service; his
memory in that respect was astonishing. He was
an able tactician, and in every respect a great
officer, with a look ‘that withered all the host.’</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a mortal foe to puppyism, and one of
our midshipmen going aloft with gloves on, attracted
his eye; for which he got such a rub down that
I am certain he remembers to the present day,
although he is a post captain, and as proud as the
devil, without any reason. Another of his freaks
was threatening to have a bowl put upon our heads
and our hair cut round in the newest fashion by
that measure. He told one of our midshipmen
(Pringle) who was a very stout man and who
happened to be in his way when looking at the
compass, ‘That he was too big for a midshipman
but would do very well as a scuttle butt,’ and,
Pringle having his hands in his pockets, he was
going to send for the tailor to sew them up. When
he first came on board to muster, a little before we
sailed, everyone was dressed in full uniform to
receive him. He took notice of this, and with
a smile (a lurking devil in it), complimented us on
our good looks, at the same time observing, ‘You
knew who was coming; but notwithstanding your
looking so well, I think I can see a little rust on
you yet which I shall endeavour to rub off.’<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Our captain was as gruff as the devil, and had a
voice like a mastiff whose growling would be heard
superior to the storm. He was very particular
respecting dress as the following order will shew:—</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><em>Memo.</em>:—</p>

<p class='c030'>If any officer shall so far forget himself
as to appear when on shore without his
uniform, I shall regard it as a mark of
his being ashamed of his profession and
discharge him from the ship accordingly.</p>

      <div class='line'>(Signed) <span class='sc'>Charles Thompson</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Captain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He had very near caught some of us in Middle
Street, Gosport, but fortunately an alley was at no
great distance through which we made a hasty but
safe retreat, and by that means prevented a few
vacancies for midshipmen taking place in the
Edgar.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now according to promise let me speak a
few words about my old mastheading friend,
Lieutenant John Stiles. When the guard-ships
went out for a cruise to blow the dust off the
harbour duty men, their complement was made up
of men and officers from those ships that remained
in port. It happened that my aforesaid friend was
sent on board of us. Now it so turned out that he
had not so much to say on board the old Edgar as he
had when on board the Salisbury (of cruel memory).
In the latter ship he had lambs to look after; in the
Edgar he had devils to look after him. In working
ship this gentleman was stationed on the forecastle,
and got the nickname from the admiral of
‘Knight of the Belfry,’<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a> because he always planted
himself there when the hands were turned up; and
from being in such a conspicuous situation, when
things went slack—which was sometimes the case—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the admiral, who had an eye like a hawk, would
damn him up in heaps, and the captain, as an able
assistant, would run forward like a bull-dog, and
roar out the second part of the same tune. I was
also stationed on the forecastle, and when those
freaks were going on, I used to look at my old
mastheading friend and grin, and he knew damned
well what I was grinning at, as the good old times
could not be forgotten. And now, John, I am done
with you.</p>

<p class='c008'>I subscribed to a concert in Gosport and one
evening I went with a messmate (the late Captain
Philpot) and some girls who I gave tickets to;
we did not break up until 12 o’clock and then went
on board. It happened unfortunately to be our
middle watch, and the rest of the watch being on
shore we relieved the deck; but, being tired and
sleepy, we thought it no harm to go to our hammocks
instead of keeping a vile watch; so, singing
the old song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I hate this damned watching and trudging the deck;</div>
      <div class='line'>The most we can get, boys, at best is a check;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sit still then, and let the lieutenants all rail,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll ride out the breeze—says Commodore Gale—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>we thought ourselves perfectly secure; and so we
should have been, had not a quarrel taken place
between two of the quartermasters’ wives, for which
one of them was turned out of the ship; but in revenge
she accused the other of smuggling four tubs
of liquor into the ship, stating the time to the first
lieutenant. Now as ill luck would have it, it proved
to be on the concert night, or rather the morning,
when the transaction took place. He then made his
report to the captain, who sent for us and with a
ferocious aspect demanded the reason of our leaving
the deck. We could give none, only Philpot said,
‘The concert, sir.’ ‘The concert, sir?’ retorted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the captain; ‘What had the concert to do with
liquor getting into the ship, and officers sleeping in
their watch? I have a great mind to try you both by
a court martial;’ and turning to the first lieutenant
he said, ‘Mr. Yetts, let them be prisoners for three
months’—or, in other words, not to be suffered to
leave the ship, even upon duty, during that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant (Yetts) was a very droll and
strange personage, in dress as well as in manners.
When he commissioned the Edgar he had on a
uniform coat made in days of yore, with sleeves
that reached to his hips, a very low collar, huge
white lappels and cuffs, the buttons behind at a
good fighting distance, and the skirts and pockets
of enormous size. A red waistcoat, nankin breeches,
and black worsted stockings, with great yellow
buckles on round-toed shoes, a hat that had been
cocked, but cut round, with a very low crown, so
that he was obliged to keep his hand to his head
to prevent its blowing off in the lightest breeze.
When he came on board in this costume, the warrant
officers thought he had made his escape from
a madhouse; and Grey, the gunner, swore he was
an understrapper from Bedlam that was come to
take Johnny Bone the boatswain (at that time half
mad from drunkenness) to the lunatic hospital.
When this was told Johnny it brought him to his
reason, and in great tribulation he locked himself up
in his storeroom and remained there the most of the
day, to the great amusement of everyone on board.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Johnny Bone was a devil of a fellow
at Cap-a-bar,<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and would stick at nothing. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>related that the late Lord Duncan, when he commanded
the Edgar, once said to him, ‘Whatever
you do, Mr. Bone, I hope and trust you will not
take the anchors from the bows.’</p>

<p class='c008'>But to return to Lieutenant Yetts; he was a
very active old man; extremely passionate, and
swore as well as his brother officers of the present
day; an excellent sailor, and though violent at
times, would hurt no one. He was also well read
in ancient and modern history. In asking him leave
to go on shore, his answer was (if out of temper),
‘No; damn my brains if you shall go.’ It happened
one night when he went on shore that Jack Kiel
(one of the midshipmen) and myself took the opportunity
and set off on a cruise in the long boat’s punt
(small boat), and landed on Gosport beach; and
having secured the boat, we took a stroll up Middle
Street, when who should pop upon us but old Yetts,
who, we thought, had gone to Portsmouth. We
took to our heels and he called after us, but was not
certain (so it appeared) to our persons. We, without
loss of time, got on board and went to our hammocks.
The moment he returned, down came the
quartermaster to acquaint us that Mr. Yetts wished
to see us. When we came upon deck he addressed
us with ‘——, Mr. Kiel and Mr. Gardner, who gave
you leave to go on shore? and why did you not
come when I called you?’ We brazened it out
that we had not been on shore and had gone to our
hammocks a considerable time, and that he must
have mistaken somebody else for us. This seemed
to stagger him, but he swore, ‘damn his brains, but
it must be us.’ He then made inquiry of the midshipmen
of the watch, but we had taken devilish
good care not to come up the side but crept in
through the gunroom port, so that they could give
him no information. By these means we weathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>him; but for more than a week after, whenever he
saw us on deck, he greeted us with, ‘Damn my
brains, but it was you.’</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a song at this time by Storace<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a>—it
began as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I left the country and my friends</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To play on my little guitar;</div>
      <div class='line'>It goes tang-tang-tang,</div>
      <div class='line'>It goes tang-tang-tang,</div>
      <div class='line'>It goes tang-tang-tang,</div>
      <div class='line'>It goes ta— etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One of our midshipmen (Vosper) altered this,
and used to sing with a thundering voice the following
burlesque to the same tune.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The other day I asked old Yetts</div>
      <div class='line in4'>For leave to go on shore;</div>
      <div class='line'>He said no, no, you shall not go,</div>
      <div class='line'>He said no, no, no, he said no,</div>
      <div class='line'>He said no no, you shall not go,</div>
      <div class='line'>By Christ, you shall not go, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I had nearly got into a second scrape about the
confounded middle watch. My friend Jack Kiel
and myself relieved the deck at 12. The rest of the
watch were absent as before. The night was as
dark as pitch, and blowing and raining most furiously,
when about five bells we got rather hungry and went
to our berth in the cockpit to stew beef steaks.
This was done by lighting several pieces of candle
in the bottom of a lantern, and sticking forks (not
silver ones) in the table round it with a plate resting
on them over the candles (the head of the lantern
being off), which stewed the steaks remarkably well.
We had scarcely finished when old Davy Jacks, the
quartermaster, came hobbling down the cockpit
ladder to inform us that the Endymion was going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>out of harbour, and had made the signal for
assistance (we had then the command). ‘Why,
Davy,’ says Kiel, ‘you must be mad to think of
such a thing. Is that all the news you have?’
‘Nothing more, sir,’ says Davy; ‘only Mr. Yetts
wants you.’ This was the unkindest cut of all.
Away we flew upon deck, saw how things were, and
went into the wardroom to answer the bell for the
officer of the watch, and found the old man nearly
dressed. ‘J—— ——,’ say he, ‘What’s the matter?
and why did you not come when I rung before?’
I told him we were looking out on the Endymion,
who had broke from her moorings and had made
the signal, and that I was just coming to acquaint
him of the circumstance. This satisfied him, and we
took good care never to be off deck again.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Phaëton, 38, having arrived from the
Mediterranean and a court martial ordered on her
captain (Geo. Dawson), and also on Messrs. Wall
and Lucas, the first and second lieutenants, and likewise
on a man by the name of Wilkie, her master—Rear-Admiral
J. Peyton hoisted his flag (white at
the mizen) on board of us as president of the court.
The lieutenants were tried the first, and sentenced
to be dismissed from their ship; and then the above-named
Wilkie, as prosecutor, exhibited fifteen
charges against Captain Dawson. The trial lasted
several days, when twelve of the charges and part of
another were brought in Scandalous, Malicious, Ill-founded,
and Derogatory to the discipline of his
Majesty’s Service; but two of the charges and part
of another being proved, he was dismissed from his
Majesty’s Service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Dawson then tried Wilkie on four
charges; part of which being proved, he was sentenced
to be dismissed from his ship—a sad punishment,
she being paid off the next day. The surgeon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>(Wardrope) had been tried before the ship arrived
and was a long time under sentence of death.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Dawson was an officer who had greatly
distinguished himself in the American War when he
commanded the Hope [schooner]. He was captain of
the Renown, 50, when she engaged and would have
taken a French 84,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a> one of the Count D’Estaing’s
fleet, had she not been rescued by some of the
enemy’s ships coming to her assistance. This trial
occasioned a great party spirit among the midshipmen,
some siding with Wilkie the prosecutor, and
others with Captain Dawson. I was for the latter,
because I thought there was malice prepense in the
prosecution. I hated the basilisk look of Wilkie,
and wished him at the devil. A violent altercation
taking place upon this subject, my old messmate
Philpot, a strong adherent to the house of Wilkie,
in the moment of irritation threw a black jack full of
beer in my face; for which compliment I instantly
knocked him down, and after a hard battle in which
he got two black eyes, I came off conqueror. Things
were going to be carried farther, but a stop was put
to it and we made it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like all ships we had some droll hands, and
with the exception of about half a dozen, all good
and worthy fellows. One or two of the half dozen
I shall mention, and begin with Geo. Wangford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>who had been in the Boreas, and was a follower of
the captain. He was an immoderate drinker, and
from his fiery countenance had the nickname of
Bardolph. While in the Edgar his mother died
and left him one thousand pounds. He lived about
six months after receiving the money in one scene
of debauchery; and with the assistance of a noted
prostitute, named Poll Palmer, in that short time
made away with nearly five hundred pounds. I
remember his being taken ill after a hard drinking
match, and then he got religious and requested one
of the midshipmen (Patrick Flood), another strange
fish, to read the Bible to him. This Patrick readily
agreed to; but before he got through a chapter
pretended to have a violent pain in his stomach,
upon which Wangford requested him to take
capillaire<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> and brandy, and that he would join him,
and desired that, in mixing, two thirds should be
brandy. Flood was immediately cured, and began
to read a chapter in Job; and when he came to that
part, ‘Then Job answered and said,’ Wangford
started up and roared out—‘that I am going to hell
before the wind.’ I lay close by them and heard
every word. He soon after turned to upon Hollands,
his favourite beverage, and thought no more of Job
or the Bible. Soon after he was sent to the
hospital, where he remained some time and died
mad. A little before his death Pringle (one of the
midshipmen) went to see him, and while sitting on
the foot of his bed he started up and seized hold of
Pringle by the hair singing out, ‘—— —— ——,
catch that bird’; the other calling out for the nurse
to assist him, which was of little use for he nearly
broke her arm before others came up to secure him.
Several of us attended his funeral.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our time passed cheerfully in the harbour;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>plenty of fun and going on shore. One night
several of us supped in the main hatchway berth on
the orlop deck, when old Andrew Macbride, the
schoolmaster (a man of splendid abilities but unfortunately
given to drinking, though the goodness
of his heart made him much respected and did away
in a great measure with that infirmity) on this
occasion got so drunk that Ned Moore (my worthy
messmate) handed him a couple of tumblers of the
juice of red pickled cabbage and told him it was
brandy and water, which he drank without taking
the least notice. I believe it did him good as an
aperient, for he was cruising about all night and
next day, and could not imagine what it was that
affected him so.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of our midshipmen (Millar), as worthy a fellow
as ever lived, told me the following anecdote of
himself and Macbride. On his joining the Hector, 74,
a guard-ship in Portsmouth Harbour, Morgan, the
first lieutenant, came up to him and said, ‘Millar, my
boy, how glad I am to see you. You must dine with
me to-day.’ Millar, who had never seen him before,
thought it rather queer that he should be so friendly
at first sight; however, he accepted the invitation.
When dinner was over, Morgan declared that he
was under a great obligation to him and that he
should at all times be happy to acknowledge it.
Poor Millar said he was really at a loss to understand
him. ‘Well then,’ says Morgan, ‘I’ll tell you.
It is this. I was considered the ugliest son of a
bitch in the fleet before you came on board, but you
beat me dead hollow, and surely you cannot wonder
at my being sensible of the obligation.’ Millar
laughed heartily, and they were ever after on the
best terms. It happened in about three months
after this, Macbride also joined the Hector. The
moment he came on board, down came the quartermaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to Millar saying that Lieutenant Morgan
wanted to see him immediately. As soon as Millar
came on the quarter deck, Morgan went up to him
and wished him joy; and pointing to Macbride
observed, ‘You, Millar, are a happy dog for being
relieved so soon. I was considered the ugliest son
of a bitch in the fleet for more than a year; you
then came on board and outdid me; but there
stands one that beggars all description, and if they
were to rake hell they could not find his fellow.’
Then going and shaking Macbride by the hand,
asked him and Millar to dine with him that day to
celebrate the happy relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Andrew once made a vow that he would not
get drunk, and said that not only the taste but the
smell of the liquor was so disagreeable that he could
not bear to stay where it was. He also gave Watson,
the boatswain, leave to thrash him with his cane if
ever he found him drunk. Poor fellow, he kept his
promise for about three months, and then turned to
as bad as ever, and Watson did not forget to give
him a lacing with his cane, which occasioned the
following song written by John Macredie:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of all the delights that a mortal can taste,</div>
      <div class='line'>A bottle of liquor is surely the best;</div>
      <div class='line'>Possessed of that treasure my hours sweetly glide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! there’s nothing like grog, says sweet Andrew Macbride.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When I sit in my school I think my time lost</div>
      <div class='line'>Where with dry sines and tangents my temper is crossed;</div>
      <div class='line'>But how sweetly I smile with the glass by my side:</div>
      <div class='line'>Grog helps mathematics, says Andrew Macbride.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The boatswain, God damn him, would fain me control</div>
      <div class='line'>With a promise when sober I made like a fool;</div>
      <div class='line'>With his cursed rattan he so curried my hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I’ll drink his damnation, says Andrew Macbride.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the sweet powers of grog have my reason betrayed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And free from sad care on the deck I am laid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the boys black my face, and my actions deride;</div>
      <div class='line'>The whelps may be damned, says Andrew Macbride.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>From the raptures of grog shall a sage be controlled,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a man like myself submit to be schooled?</div>
      <div class='line'>If I’m drunk, the lieutenant and captain may chide;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I’ll drink till I die, says sweet Andrew Macbride.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When I said the smell hurt me, the fools did believe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Och hone! my dear friends, I did you deceive;</div>
      <div class='line'>When the taste or smell hurts me, may hell open wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I, damned there with water to drink, says Macbride.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nothing disrespectful was intended by this song.
Every officer in the ship was a friend to poor
Andrew, and Macredie would have been one of
the first to resent an insult offered to him. It is a
strange coincidence that on the day we were paid
off, I saw Macbride sitting on the taffrail reading
Ossian’s poems, and looking at a fine engraving of
the Spirit of Crugal.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Twelve years after in Port
Royal Harbour, Jamaica, I went to answer the
signal for lieutenant on board the Leviathan, 74 (I
then belonged to the Brunswick), and going on the
poop to write the order, I saw a figure sitting on the
taffrail, who I thought I knew, in deep meditation.
On going up to him I recognised my old messmate
Macbride, with the identical book and the engraving
of the Spirit of Crugal in his hand. The poor
fellow was most happy to see me, but how altered!
He went back with me to dinner, and I gave him
some classical books that pleased him greatly. His
bones are lying at the Palisades. He was one of
the first mathematicians in Europe; an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>writer in prose and verse, an able disputant, and
possessed a mind remarkable for the strictest
integrity. ‘Tread lightly on his ashes, ye men of
genius, for he was your kinsman.’<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I must here say a word about poor unfortunate
Patrick Flood. When first I knew him in the
American War, he was a fine officer-like looking
fellow; but when he joined the Edgar he was sadly
reduced from long illness in the West Indies; and
from domestic troubles, and disappointment at not
getting promotion, grew regardless of himself and
reckless of his character. Cynical to a degree and
used to caricature us upon every occasion, I remember
his making a very ludicrous drawing of
Macbride, representing him sitting on the deck with
the boys blacking his face and a bottle and a glass
alongside of him; and [underneath it, some scurrilous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>verses, which Macbride answered with others
still more indecent].</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Edgar was paid off, Captain A. J. P.
Molloy<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> was appointed to the command of her, and
Flood was continued as one of the midshipmen.
Having obtained leave to go to London to try and
raise friends to get his promotion, he succeeded in
getting the promise from Lord Chatham; but unfortunately
having staid a short time above his leave,
Captain Molloy, in answer to Lord Chatham’s letter
respecting him, cruelly said he considered Mr. Flood
in no other light than that of a deserter. This was
the ruin of poor Flood, who died in penury, but
lived long enough to witness the downfall of his
enemy. And now let me mention my worthy messmate
John Macredie, a gentleman that did honour
to society and one that was highly respected by a
numerous acquaintance. He had seen a great deal
of service and was on board the Hercules, 74, in
Rodney’s action on the 12th of April 1782. He
was also on board the Princess Royal, 98, and
Pégase, 74, and then joined the Edgar, and was a
messmate of mine for three years, and again in the
Barfleur for upwards of a twelvemonth. He was an
excellent scholar, being well acquainted with the
Greek and Latin, and was deeply read in ancient
history and nearly equal to Macbride in mathematics.
The author of many plays that were never printed,
as he would not allow them to be sent to the press,
although strongly urged by those who were competent
judges of their merit. He was also a good poet
and possessed undaunted courage, and was as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>generous as he was brave. At the same time he
was one of the most absent [minded] men that can be
imagined. I have known him when going to answer
a signal come on deck with one boot and one shoe
on; and when sent below in consequence, come up
again with his black stock with the inside turned
out. One morning when alongside of the flagship,
on stepping from the boat to the accommodation
ladder he dropped the order book overboard, and in
trying to get hold of it he let go his sword, which
sunk in a moment. I have also known him walk
nearly two miles out of Gosport before he recollected
that he had only to go to his tailor’s, who lived near
the beach.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must not forget another worthy fellow and
messmate of mine, the late Lieutenant Edward
Moore, at this time one of the mates. Ned was as
brave and generous a soul as ever lived; a determined
enemy to tyranny, as the following circumstance
will shew. When the present Retired Rear-Admiral
Shield<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> was first lieutenant of the Saturn,
74, at Spithead in the year 1791 or 1792, one evening
in the first watch he ordered one of the midshipmen
(Mr. Leonard) on some trifling occasion to the masthead
for punishment. Mr. L. said he would go
there with pleasure if it was on duty, but not for
punishment; upon which Mr. Shield had him made
fast to a girtline and triced up to the main topmast-head
without a guy to keep him clear of the top etc.
This made a great stir both on board and on shore,
and Mr. Leonard was advised to commence proceedings
by entering an action against Shield; and
a subscription was set on foot to defray the
expenses attending it. My friend Ned at this time
belonged to the London, 98, lying at Spithead; and
he wrote letters to the midshipmen of the other men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of war to subscribe also. This coming to the
knowledge of Lord Hood, he considered it as a
conspiracy injurious to the discipline of the navy,
and Moore was put under an arrest. A court of
inquiry was held, and then a court martial, where
Sir Hyde Parker stood as prosecutor; and after
a long examination of witnesses, Moore was found
guilty of contempt of court and sentenced to be confined
in the Marshalsea for one month, a fortnight
of which he remained on board the guard-ship.
The other charge was not proved. The late
Admiral Macbride, who commanded the Cumberland,
74, at that time, was a member of the court, and
was a friend to Moore ever after, and made him
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of our midshipmen, who lately died a post
captain, was an infernal tyrant. While in the
Edgar, this chap one evening began his tricks by
thrashing one of the youngsters, a messmate of
Ned’s, and for so doing Ned gave him, to the great
joy of all, the most severe drubbing I ever witnessed.
Ned had been a shipmate of this person’s before in
the Queen, 98, when a guard-ship, and had seen
some of his pranks there and now paid him on the
old score.</p>

<p class='c008'>While lying at the Hardway moorings, about
three o’clock one morning we heard a voice halloing
out ‘Come here, you sleepy-headed hounds, and take
me out of a hole that I have got into.’ It being low
water, the voice appeared to come from the mud.
Two or three of us got into the cutter (for we always
kept a boat out)<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and went in the direction of the
voice, where we found Moore up to his middle, and
being a stout fellow it was no easy matter to
extricate him. Had we not gone when we did he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>would have been suffocated as the tide was flowing.
He had been keeping it up and missed his way to
the Hard. He was one that would part with his
last shilling to serve a friend or assist those in
distress. I recollect while lying in Torbay with the
grand fleet (we belonged to the Barfleur, 98, then),
that I had not a sixpence and no opportunity of
sending home; and I wanted to go on shore, and
how to raise the wind I did not know; which
coming to the ears of Ned, says he, ‘Tony, I have
got a guinea and I am determined that you shall
have half of it’—which he made me take. Would
to God that he was alive and that I could shake
hands with him now, and the rest of the brave
fellows that are no more. <i><span lang="la">Sit tibi terra levis!</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>We had a custom when the officers were at
dinner in the wardroom, of dividing into parties;
one division was to storm the other on the poop.
In one of those attacks I succeeded in getting on
the poop, when Kiel (who I have mentioned before)
attacked me with a fixed bayonet and marked me in
the thigh (all in good part). I then got hold of a
musket, put in a small quantity of powder, and as
he advanced, I fired. To my horror and amazement
he fell flat on the deck, and when picked up
his face was as black as a tinker’s, with the blood
running down occasioned by some of the grains of
powder sticking in. I shall never forget the terror
I was in, but thank God he soon got well; only a
few blue spots remained in his phiz, which never
left him. This was the only time I ever fired a
musket and probably will be the last. They used
to say in the cockpit that he was troubled with St.
Anthony’s fire (alluding to my name).</p>

<p class='c008'>Another time when attacking the poop, I was
standing on one of the quarter deck guns, when I
received a violent blow on the face from a broomstick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>which made my nose bleed off and on for
several days. It was thrown at me by J. S. Carden
(now Captain Carden<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a>) and a hand swab was thrown
at him, which falling short, entered one of the office
windows, which put an end to the attack. It was
laughable to see John Macredie take the part of
Ajax Telamon, with a half-port for a shield and a
boarding-pike for a lance. Culverhouse used to
take the part of Diomede, but instead of a lance
would use the single-stick, with which he was
superior to anyone in the fleet. He was a very
clever fellow, full of fun and drollery, and sung
humorous songs in the most comic style. I
remember a verse or two of one:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When first they impressed me and sent me to sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas in the winter time in the making of hay,</div>
      <div class='line'>They sent me on board of a ship called Torbay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! her white muzzle guns they did sore frighten me,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Musha tudey, etc.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Says the boatswain to Paddy, And what brought you here?</div>
      <div class='line'>For the making of hay ’tis the wrong time of year.</div>
      <div class='line'>By Jasus, says Paddy, I wish I was gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>For your small wooden kingdom I don’t understand.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Musha tudey, etc.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh! the first thing they gave me it was a long sack,<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Which they tould me to get in and lay on my back;</div>
      <div class='line'>I lay on my back till the clock struck one bell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the man overhead he sung out, All is well.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Musha tudey, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We had a very droll midshipman who lately
died an old post captain, and was one of the best
officers in the service. This gentleman was a kind
of ventriloquist, and when we sat in the officers’ seat
in Gosport chapel, and opposite to old Paul the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>clerk, of beer-drinking memory, whenever this man
would begin to sing, the other would go Quack,
Quack, Quack; sometimes high and sometimes
low, according as the clerk would sing the psalm.
I have seen the old fellow look round with amazement,
the people whispering to one another, while
others could not keep their countenance but would
hold their heads down and laugh. I remember him
coming on board late one night in a wherry from
Gosport, and it being calm we could hear him
quacking a long way off. We then lay at the
Hardway moorings. When the wherry got alongside
the waterman swore he would be damned
sooner than have that chap in his boat again. Had
he known as much, he would not have taken him
off for any money; he certainly was the devil or his
near relation, for some hell-hound or other had been
following him on the water all the way from Burrow
Castle (near the Magazine and reported to be
haunted) until he got alongside. He said he knew
that Burrow Castle was haunted and he’d take good
care to return on the other side of the harbour, and
blast him if he’d ever come that way at night.
I had the watch upon deck at the time and remember
every word, and I thought I should have
died a-laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant had an inveterate hatred to
the Barfleur (the flagship) for the following reason.
The signal was made for all midshipmen, and I had
just returned in the long boat from Spithead, where
we had been fishing, and was then going to relieve
the deck, it being my watch, when Lieutenant Yetts
ordered me to answer the signal. On my asking
him leave to go below and get ready, as I was
certain they would turn me back if I went in the
dress I had on, ‘Mr. Gardner, will you dictate to
me?’ was his reply; ‘Go as you are, sir.’ When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>I got on board the Barfleur, Lieutenant Ross (who
I knew very well) was commanding officer. The
moment he saw me he came up, and with eyes of
a dog fish, asked who I was and where I came
from. I could hardly help laughing at the question.
However, I explained to him the reason, but all to
no purpose, as he sent me into my boat saying,
‘Tell your officer that I made the signal for a midshipman,
and not for a fisherman, and he ought to
have known better from the length of time he had
been in the service.’</p>

<p class='c008'>On my delivering this insolent message to
Lieutenant Yetts, it put him in a great rage and he
swore, damn his brains, but he’d remember Master
Ross for his kindness, the first opportunity. This
Ross was a satirist, or would be thought so, because
he wrote some poem in doggerel rhymes of scurrilous
merit, abusing some of the officers of the
guard-ships and many of the respectable people of
Gosport. He also wrote a play which was damned
and hissed off the stage, and some other pieces of
the same description. Soon after this it came to
our turn to have the guard, and late in the first
watch, Lieutenant Yetts sent for me and gave orders
that I should go in the cutter and row guard, and if
possible get alongside the Barfleur. Away I went
round the guard-ships, and left the Barfleur for the
last. On rowing ahead I let the boat drop down
with the tide and actually got alongside her accommodation
ladder without being hailed. It is the
duty of a lieutenant to row guard, so I did not think
myself justified in boarding her, which I could have
done; but remained some time alongside. At last
one of the midshipmen (Mr. Holmes) hailed from
the gangway, ‘What boat is that?’ upon which
I called out as loud as I could hollo, ‘Guard boat!’
and that I had been alongside a considerable time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>without being hailed—to his great astonishment, as
he informed me afterwards. On my telling this to
Mr. Yetts, he rubbed his hands and swore that
everyone should know how the damned brutes were
caught napping.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of the admiral we, as senior
captain, would have the command; and when
exercising sails or getting down top gallant yards
etc, if the Barfleur only showed a man’s head
above deck, up would go her signal to call her men
down out of the tops and rigging, and old Yetts
would exclaim, ‘Damn my brains, no starting before
us; we are masters now.’ Mr. Nowell, our second
lieutenant, was a very powerful and active man; and
though gloomy and fiery at times, was much the
gentleman. He was famous at fencing and
jumping, and could, as I have been told, jump
across the gateway of Gosport works—about twenty
feet. On one occasion he sprained his ankle,
when Frost (one of our midshipmen) said in his
hearing and mocking the Welsh (Nowell being a
Welshman) ‘My vather a tevil of a good shumper,
shumped twenty veet, came right down, proke his
ankle, could no more shumpy.’ For this the other
gave him a look that spoke volumes.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Frost was a complete Commodore Gale
and went by the nickname of Hard Frost. It is
related that when his wife died he gave a dinner
on the day of her funeral. When the company
arrived, Frost was dead drunk; upon which some
of the party laid him out, with a leg of mutton
under his head for a pillow, and a bunch of turnips
under his feet. In the early time of the guard-ships
there was a board held by the midshipmen of the
Queen, 98, the flagship, where the midshipmen
of the other ships used to go to pass their examination
for a blackguard. Frost, who belonged to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Pégase, 74, went to pass, and on the occasion
showed such transcendent abilities, that the board
considered him a wonder, and requested he would
take his seat as a member. I could relate many
of his sayings, but they had better sink into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant was a devil for scrubbing
decks, and in the dead of winter we frequently had
to shovel the snow from the quarter deck, and take
a spell, about half-past four in the morning, with
the holystone and hand organs, while the water
would freeze as soon as it was thrown on the deck.
The general order, made into rhyme by Flood [was]
as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The decks, as usual, to be washed and scrubbed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with the holystone severely rubbed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To show the superstition of sailors I must
mention the following anecdote. Not a hundred
miles from Portsmouth lived a great nabob, who
formerly possessed a large fortune, but from gambling
and other bad management had greatly fallen
off, and the neighbours used to say he had dealings
with the devil, and at night would converse with
him in his cellar. We had a raven on board that
came from this neighbourhood; and from the
number of strange pranks it was in the habit of
playing, was supposed by the ship’s company
not to have been one of this world; and what
strengthened this opinion was Macredie giving it
out that he had heard the raven speak, and say that
he had been the nabob’s coachman, and should
resume his office as soon as the ship was paid off,
and he had got some recruits for his master. This
made him be looked at with an evil eye by the
ship’s company; and one evening when the provisions
were serving out and several of the people
were in the cockpit about the steward’s room, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>raven caught hold of the gunner’s mate by the
trowsers, croaking and snapping at his legs. He
then flew on the shoulder of the corporal of marines,
took off his hat and hid it in the tier. ‘I’m damned,’
says old Phillips, the quartermaster, ‘if he has not
marked you for his master.’ He had hardly said
this when the raven came hopping back and seized
upon the cheese belonging to the quartermaster,
and walked off with a large piece of it, the other
being afraid to follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another of his tricks I was an eye-witness to.
Our sergeant of marines had leave to go on shore,
and was on the poop showing a half-guinea to the
corporal, saying ‘With this bit of gold I shall take
a cruise, it will last as long as I like to stay.’ He
was holding the half-guinea between his finger and
thumb, and asked the raven, who was on the poop,
if he would take a trip with him. Ralph, ever on
the watch, in an instant snapped the half-guinea out
of his hand, and flew up to the main topmast head
and remained more than an hour aloft, the sergeant
all the time in the greatest anxiety, and some of the
fellows saying to him, ‘Now, don’t you believe he’s
the devil?’ At last the raven flew down upon the
booms and went into the stern sheets of the barge
lying there and hid the half-guinea, which the
sergeant found, but swore it was not the same that
was taken from him, while several called out ‘Sold!
Sold!’<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now conclude the Edgar after saying a
word for Davy Reed, the master. He was what
we call a hard officer, as well as a very strange sort
of fish, and had the misfortune, like many others, to
lose his teeth. I was at dinner in the wardroom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>when a small parcel was handed in directed for
Mr. Reed. ‘What the hell can this be?’ says
Davy (who did not like to have sixpence to pay
the waterman), ‘and who gave it to you?’ continued
he. ‘Sir,’ says the waterman, ‘it was a young
lady who sent it off from Common Hard.’ As
several tricks had been played with Davy before, he
was afraid to open the parcel, and begged of one of
the officers at the table to do so for him, but when
opened, what was his amazement to find a set of
sheep’s teeth for David Reed, Esq., with directions
for fixing, and a box of tooth powder that, by the
smell, appeared to be a mixture of everything
abominable. Poor Davy was in a dreadful rage,
and never heard the last of it. The Edgar was
paid off in January 1790, and we had a parting
dinner at the India Arms, Gosport, and kept it up
until twelve that night. With the exception of the
half dozen, they were some of the best fellows I ever
met with. The Edgar was commissioned immediately
after by Captain Anthony James Pye Molloy,
and some of the midshipmen rejoined her.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>BARFLEUR, 98</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>When the Edgar was paid off, Commissioner
Martin<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a> of the dockyard at Portsmouth, recommended
me to the Barfleur, Vice-Admiral Roddam
(red at the fore) port admiral, and Robert Calder,
Esq., captain. I had not been long on board when
Captain Calder took it into his head to recommend
several of us to the Solebay, 32, fitting at Spithead
for the West Indies, and I was one of the number.
This did not suit my inclination, and I requested
my mother to make the circumstance known to the
commissioner, who promised her that I should not
be sent out against my will. I waited with great
anxiety the result, and never shall I forget the manner
Captain Calder addressed me the moment he came
on board. ‘Your mother is a fool, sir; you shall
not stay in my ship; take your hat off, sir’ (for we
were always obliged to stand with our hats off while
speaking to him and I was rather slack in doffing
mine); ‘I will give you one month to provide
yourself with another ship, you are disgraced here;’
and then turning on his heel went into his cabin.
With rage and indignation at such an unwarrantable
attack, I sent in to say I would be glad to
speak to him if he was at leisure. This he immediately
granted, and I was told after by Jefferys, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>clerk, who was in the cabin, that he thought I had
made up my mind to go, but he was mistaken. I
told him I came to return him thanks for his kindness
in allowing me to remain in his ship for a
month until I could provide myself with another,
but if he pleased I would rather have my discharge
immediately. He looked at me for some time
before he made an answer; at last he roared out in
fury, ‘You shall not go at all, sir; and mind what
you are about.’ I answered that I always did mind
what I was about. This increased his rage, and
turning to the first lieutenant (Dolling), who had
just come into the cabin, ‘That’s a troublesome
chap, sir, take care of him.’ Now it happened that
I had leave to go on shore before Captain C. came
on board and only waited till I saw him, and was
going into the boat, when Lieutenant Dolling came
waddling up to me with the intelligence that I was
under arrest, and to consider myself a prisoner at
large; and so I was for upwards of ten weeks,
and the devil thank Bobby Calder for his kindness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Spanish armament taking place, we were
ordered to Spithead, and hoisted the flag (blue at
the main) of the Honourable Samuel Barrington,
Sir John Jervis (rear-admiral of the blue) captain of
the fleet, and Captain Calder in command of the
ship. Sailed for Torbay, and took command of the
fleet assembled there, until the arrival of Lord
Howe, which took place soon after, as admiral of
the fleet, the union jack being hoisted on board
the Queen Charlotte, 110.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> His Royal Highness
the Duke of Cumberland, admiral of the white,
attended by Prince William Henry, who commanded
the Valiant, 74, came on board to visit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Admiral Barrington, who had formerly sailed with
the duke. Admiral Barrington having shifted his
flag to the Royal George, 110, we hoisted that of
Rear-Admiral Sir John Jervis, K.B., and sailed to
the westward with the grand fleet, and found the
old Barfleur an excellent sea boat. After cruising
several weeks the fleet returned, and when off Plymouth
we struck the flag of Sir John Jervis, and
proceeded to the Downs and hoisted the flag (blue
at the fore) of Vice-Admiral Elliot, and sailed with
thirteen sail of the line for Spithead, where we
found Lord Howe with the remainder of the fleet,
Captain Calder having been appointed to the
Stately, 64. Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds
took command of the Barfleur as flag captain. The
chief part of the midshipmen being removed to the
Stately, Captain Calder sent for me and introduced
me to Captain Reynolds, and spoke to him
in the highest terms of my conduct, and among
other things said I was particularly active in going
aloft, and if I wished to leave the Barfleur he would
keep a vacancy open on his books; but that the
Barfleur being a flagship and my pay better, he
thought it the most eligible of the two to remain.
This was a civil way of parting to outward appearance
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Spanish business being settled we remained
at Spithead but struck our flag. Soon after a
mutiny broke out in the ship, which was soon put a
stop to, and the crews of the ships at Spithead (as
many as liked) paid off. The Russian armament
commencing, Lord Hood hoisted his flag on board
the Victory, 100, and took command of the fleet,
consisting of thirty-six sail of the line moored in
two lines abreast, the frigates between, which had a
most beautiful appearance, and thousands from all
parts of the country came to gaze, and went back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>as wise as ever. Rear-Admiral Jonathan Faulknor<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
(red at the mizen) having hoisted his flag on board
of us, that excellent officer Captain Reynolds left
the ship and was succeeded by Captain John Bourmaster,
one of the best men that ever lived. We
remained a considerable time at Spithead until the
business was settled, and then went into harbour to
be paid off.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now relate as well as I remember a few
circumstances that took place in the Barfleur during
the time I belonged to her. When we had the
command in Torbay, before the arrival of Lord
Howe, we exercised great guns and small arms
every day, with loosing and furling sails, and it was
remarked by the fleet that they never looked at the
Barfleur without seeing the men crawling up the
rigging ready for some manœuvre and keeping
them constantly on the alert. I have absolutely
been midshipman in the foretop when the sail has
been loosed and furled nineteen times; and long
Lloyd (one of our lieutenants) calling out from the
gratings on the bowsprit, ‘Mr. Gardner, will you
have your hammock sent up to you?’—a common
expression in the navy. I could not help answering,
‘I’ll thank you, sir, for I’m damnation tired.’ He
was a good fellow and only laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our ship’s company were never surpassed. We
had the pickings of the East India men, and our
waisters could take helm and lead, and certainly we
could have beaten with ease any two ships of a
foreign power of our rate, and a braver officer never
stepped between stem and stern than Bobby Calder.
I had great reason to dislike him, but I will do him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>justice as well as my humble abilities will allow.
An error in judgment is what every man is liable to.
Even Napoleon, the greatest man the world ever
produced, was guilty of three great errors: the first
in not entirely crushing the Russian army when he
had it in his power after defeating the Emperor
Alexander at Austerlitz; the second in not reinstating
the Poles; and the third in not marrying a
Frenchwoman after his divorce from Josephine.
Another great general also made a few blunders;
and his retreat from a certain citadel was, I have
been told, anything but superior to that of the ten
thousand under Xenophon.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a> But to return. Sir
Robert Calder was found guilty of an error in judgment
by the sentence of a court martial; but no
man can deny that he was a brave and meritorious
officer, possessing the first-rate<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a> abilities of a British
admiral.</p>

      <div class='line'>A wise, extensive, all considering mind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The newspapers at the time were teeming with
abuse; but the braying of those asses soon sunk,
and had no other effect than to shew the malignity
of their leading articles. One of the blackguard
papers was particularly vindictive. It was edited</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>by wicked Daniel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who snaps like a cur, and fawns like a spaniel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>From the number of flag officers and captains
that were in the Barfleur, we had so many of their
followers of every description that it is difficult to
remember the whole, and we had six or seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>different first lieutenants. However, I shall give as
correct a list as possible, but not exactly in rotation.
But first I must relate a few anecdotes; and with
heart-felt respect for your memory, come forward
my old friend Billy Culmer. This gentleman was
one of the mates and is or was so well known in
the navy that it would be superfluous to say anything
respecting him, but for a few anecdotes not
generally known which may be interesting.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Billy in person was about five feet eight or nine,
and stooped; hard features marked with the smallpox;
blind in an eye, and a wen nearly the size of
an egg under his cheek bone. His dress on a
Sunday was a mate’s uniform coat, with brown
velvet waistcoat and breeches; boots with black
tops; a gold-laced hat, and a large hanger by his
side like the sword of John-a-Gaunt. He was
proud of being the oldest midshipman in the navy
(for he had been in that capacity with Lord Hood
since 1757<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a>), and looked upon young captains and
lieutenants with contempt. Being on shore at
Gosport on a Sunday in the above costume, he
tried to get into a tavern when the people were at
church, and was thundering at the door to no
purpose, when the late Captain N. H. Eastwood of
the Royal Navy happened to be passing at the time
in plain clothes, made some observations on his
conduct, and said, ‘Mr. Culmer, you are a disgrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to the service.’ Billy at this jumped off the steps, and
with his usual oath ‘Damn my two eyes,’—though
he had but one—‘but I’ll slit your gullet, you wa
wa——,’ and with two or three desperate efforts to
draw his sword, he at last succeeded, like Hudibras,
in getting it out, and then gave chase to Eastwood,
whose lean figure, moving like a ghost, had got the
start and was fortunate enough to get into his own
house just as Billy came up puffing and blowing
and bellowing out, ‘Stop that lanky son of a —— till
I make a razee of him.’</p>

<p class='c008'>In the American War Billy belonged to the
Buffalo, 60. I am not certain that he was on board
at the time the Dogger Bank action was fought;
however, he used to celebrate the praises of his old
ship, which bore a distinguished part in that well-fought
battle. The Dutch fleet commanded by
Admiral Zoutman had a convoy under charge, when
our fleet under Vice-Admiral Hyde Parker fell in
with them on the Dogger Bank and bore down
immediately to give battle. The Dutch admiral
formed his line to windward of his convoy, and
waited for our fleet, and to his honour be it said
that he never fired a gun until our admiral had
formed his line within pistol shot, when up went the
colours of both nations and then the action began.
After several hours’ desperate fighting the Dutch
bore away with their convoy for the Texel, and we
were so crippled that it was impossible to follow them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Billy would upon all occasions when sea fights
were spoken of sing the following song in honour
of his old ship. It was made by a seaman of the
Princess Amelia.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Twas on the fifth of August by dawning of the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>We spied some lofty sail, my boys, who to leeward of us lay;</div>
      <div class='line'>They proved to be Dutchmen, with eight sail neat and fine,</div>
      <div class='line'>We soon bore down upon them, and then we formed the line.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Bold Admiral Hyde Parker commanded us that day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in the noble Fortitude to the windward of us lay;</div>
      <div class='line'>To engage the Dutchmen closely the signal then he made,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at his fore topgallant mast the bloody flag displayed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And when our ships they did engage with seven sail neat and fine,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Buffalo being one of them, her valour it did shine;</div>
      <div class='line'>For she engaged six glasses, her shot did on them play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though she had three upon her she made them bear away.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There were the noble Berwick, Preston and Dolphin too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Likewise the Bienfaisant, my boys, who made the Dutch to rue;</div>
      <div class='line'>The old Princess Amelia was not backward on that day,</div>
      <div class='line'>She lost her valiant captain all in the bloody fray.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then our ship being so disabled and our rigging shot away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And twenty of our brave fellows killed in the bloody fray;</div>
      <div class='line'>And sixty-four were wounded, a dreadful sight to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet the rest were willing to engage the enemy, &#38;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Billy was once singing the above ditty with a
voice as melodious as that of the raven, when old
Bob Perkins (a droll old guardo midshipman) began
another that annoyed him sadly; but taking great
care to be in a place where Billy could not easily
get at him, says he, ‘Mr. Culmer, you never were a
midshipman before you joined the Barfleur, and it’s
well authenticated that you were cook of the celebrated
Huffey so well known in days of yore.’ He
then began singing the following sonnet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Billy the cook got drunk,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Fell down the fore ladder,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And broke his gin bladder,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then lived upon swipes and salt junk.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Billy the cook got drunk,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Fell into a sty,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And knocked out his eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then into the sick bay he slunk.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As [Billy] had the meanest opinion of any one
that would lay by for sickness, the last line of the
above threw him into such a rage that Perkins, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>finding his situation tenable, was obliged to make
a hasty retreat; but not before</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>he got a switch</div>
      <div class='line'>As quick as lightning on the breech,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>which hastened his way down the cockpit ladder.
[Billy] was once sitting in the gunroom cleaning a
pair of huge yellow buckles, when the same Perkins
chalked on a board in large letters, ‘To be seen
alive—The old blind sea monster, cleaning buckles
as large as the main hatchway.’ The moment he
got sight of the inscription, [Billy] caught hold of a
cutlass from the stand and cleared the gunroom in
an instant, and had very near given it to Perkins,
whom he suspected. He had a custom, when half
seas over, of sounding a horn like a huntsman and
calling the hounds, and used to swear he would be
in at the death.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he went to pass for lieutenant, one of the
midshipmen and Marr the boatswain went up to
London with him. They found it no easy matter
to keep him in order, and he once swore to have
them taken up as runaway soldiers. When he went
to the navy board to undergo his examination he
asked the commissioners the meaning of the word
‘azimuth’ and told them he could never find any
wa wa that knew a word about it. Some of the
board had been shipmates with him and were well
acquainted with his ways; and when putting him
right when answering a question, he would say,
‘Go on, go on, my boy, that’s the way; you are
very right,’ as if he was passing them; and when
they told him they had no more questions to ask,
he said he was glad of it and would go back to his
ship like a lark.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night soon after his return, when he had
the first watch, some of the midshipmen reefed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>blankets—this is done by making the ends fast
and forming by numerous turns the blanket into
the shape of a ring very difficult to undo. As soon
as he was relieved he went to his hammock and
groping about (for he never would take a light into
the tier), he was heard to mutter, ‘What the hell
have they done with the ends?’ and at last roared
out, ‘A horse’s collar, by God.’ After several fruitless
attempts to shake the reef out, he went upon
deck and brought down the ship’s corporal and
quartermaster with a light, and ordered them to
clear his blankets; but they were as unable as himself,
while the midshipmen in the tier were convulsed
with laughter, and Billy, foaming with rage,
drove away the corporal and quartermaster, calling
them lubberly wa wa ——s. At this time a cry was
heard from a remote part of the tier, ‘Lay out, you
lubberly rascal, and shake the reef out.’ At this
Billy lost all patience, and after damning his two
eyes he unshipped the orlop gratings and got some
billets of wood out of the hold, and in less than a
minute the tier was cleared. Soon after some of
the watch came down and put his bedding to rights
and all was quiet. The same compliment that
Cicero paid to Cæsar may also be paid to Billy,
“that he remembered everything but an injury.”
The next morning he thought nothing of the
matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speaking about the Roman history respecting
the battle of Actium between Augustus and Antony,
he said he was in the battle and remembered all
about it. The fact was he mistook the name and
thought it was some place where he had been in the
American war. He never heard the last of this,
and when speaking of any battle where he had been
present, was always asked if it took place thirty
years before Christ. Captain Calder once sent for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>him to go in the launch for beer to Weevil.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> ‘Go
back,’ says he to the quartermaster, ‘and tell Captain
C. that Mr. Wood’ (meaning Lord Hood, who
he never called by his right name) ‘never sent me
away at seven bells and I shan’t go now without my
dinner. As soon as I have got that I will go like a
lark—damn my two eyes.’ Of course this was not
told the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we had Admiral Roddam’s flag in the
harbour, a Dutch ship of the line anchored at Spithead
and used to fire the morning and evening gun,
without our taking notice of the circumstance.
However, Bobby Calder soon found it out and came
on board in a terrible rage, and gave the commanding
officer (Prowse) a severe lecture, and told us all
to prepare for a court martial for neglect in not
reporting the transaction; at the same time sending
a message to the Dutchman that if he persisted in
such conduct a ship of the line would be sent alongside
of him. This the Dutchman did not relish and
took himself off as quick as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Calder was a man that had the service
at heart and was a very strict disciplinarian. We
dared not appear on deck without our full uniform,
and a round hat was never allowed; our side arms
always on the quarter deck ready for duty, and
when exercising sails the midshipmen in the tops
were to be in full dress. I remember when the
signal was made for all lieutenants while lying in
Torbay, that several came on board not exactly in
uniform. He, without hearing a word they had to
say, turned them out of the ship with a severe reprimand—old
Lieutenant Noah Webb (with his crossjack
brace<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a> eye), who commanded a cutter at the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of them; and when the late Sir Joseph Yorke (then
a lieutenant) came on board at Spithead with strings
in his shoes, Captain Calder came running out of his
cabin and desired him to quit the ship immediately;
and though Sir Joseph told him he was not on duty,
it was all to no purpose; he kept following him to
the gangway saying, ‘My hat’s off, sir; you must go
out of the ship,’ which the other was obliged to do
in high dudgeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>In working the ship no one was allowed to speak
but himself, and I have seen the Barfleur brought to
an anchor and the sails furled like magic, without a
voice being heard except his own.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

    </div>

<p class='c008'>No ship in the navy was in such high order.
The midshipmen’s berths were fitted up in great
style (the beginning of luxury which the war soon
after put a stop to), with rules and regulations. If a
candle was taken off the table a fine of sixpence
must be paid; and a shilling, if a hat was hung up
in the berth or left on the chairs. This was all very
well for the dandy aristocracy, but did not suit some
of us that formerly belonged to the old Edgar; and
Dick Heycock was the first to kick, and refused to
abide by the regulations laid down by a proud and
usurping few; and we carried our point, and things
went on much better when the petty tyranny was
abolished. Captain Calder would always bring the
nobility that visited the ship to see the midshipmen’s
berths, and used to say: ‘This is the place where
all the admirals and captains in the service are tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>every day, and where no one escapes being hauled
over the coals.’</p>

<p class='c008'>No man could be more attentive at his table, and
he would particularly address himself to the midshipmen,
and even ask their opinion upon different
subjects, to give them confidence. Mrs. Calder was
very fond of boat-sailing, and we had a large double
banked cutter in which she would go to Spithead
when blowing very fresh, and carrying sail as if in
chase until the boat’s gunwale was under, so that
everyone thought she was mad; and very few liked
the trip except in fine weather, as she would always
feel offended if any attempt was made to take in
sail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the many first lieutenants, we had one that
was very pedantic. I shall not mention his name,
but his nickname was Soap-Suds. The signal
being made for all midshipmen, the order<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> was that
a preparative flag would be hoisted before any
manœuvre began, but when hauled down it was
immediately to take place. Now not content with
what was written in the order book, he addressed
the midshipmen as follows: ‘The idea strikes me
thus, that when the preparative is hauled down, the
evo-lu-ti-on will most certainly commence, and this
pennant is your signal.’</p>

<p class='c008'>We had another strange first lieutenant—this
was Billy Chantrell, well known in the service. In
giving his orders at night he used to say, ‘Call me
at six, and don’t come bothering me about blowing
and raining and all that damned nonsense.’
I was with him in three ships and never met with
so droll and strange a fellow. In passing Fairlight,
near Hastings, on our way from the Downs to Spithead,
Chantrell, pointing out to me the cliff near the
church on Fairlight Down, said, ‘Jemmy, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>would you like to be perched up there in the
winter?’ Little did he imagine that in some years
after, when the war broke out and signal stations
were erected along the coast, he should be the
first officer appointed to this very spot, and I, the
last; which was the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>We led a very lazy life at Spithead for several
months, and it was expected we should strike upon
our beef bones, as we never shifted our berth. We
had nothing to do but row guard and go for fresh
beef. Captain Bourmaster lived at Tichfield, and
if anything particular happened a boat was sent
with a midshipman to Hellhead or near it with the
orders. On one occasion Mr. S——s, a midshipman,
was dispatched in the cutter and took some of
the boat’s crew with him to Tichfield. On their
return, passing by a farmyard, a flock of ducks and
geese began to quack and hiss at them. The midshipman
considered this as a declaration of war,
and ordered his party to prepare for battle and to
engage close, which was instantly obeyed, and after
a short contest the enemy took to flight and several
of the ducks were captured. Now the midshipman
had read a little of British history, and particularly
remembered that part where Richard the First in
Palestine, and Henry the Fifth at Agincourt, put
their prisoners to death. He immediately followed
their example, and ordered the ducks to be
slaughtered. Now the difference between those
great men was this, that Richard and Henry buried
their prisoners or got somebody else to do it, but
the midshipman carried his off; and seeing in an
orchard near the farmyard a number of fruit trees
heavily laden, he thought it just that those who
began the war should pay the expenses, which was
no new thing in modern warfare, and gave orders
to his party to fill their jackets with pears and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>apples, observing that it would ease the trees of
their burthen and the boughs would be in less danger
of breaking down. Now all this was very fair; and
peace being restored, the midshipman addressed
the farmer (who had come up with the reserve, but
too late to assist the main body after their defeat):
‘I say, old Hodge, I wish you joy to see your nose
and chin come together after being separated for so
many years. But harkee, old chap, if I should
come this way again, and your feather-bed sons
of —— begin their capers, I’m damned if I don’t
stop the grog of every mother’s son belonging to
you.’ So saying, he returned with his dead
prisoners, and the war was considered at an end.
But the farmer, being bloody-minded, was of a different
opinion, and breathing revenge, went and
made his report to Captain Bourmaster. The
captain, after coolly and deliberately weighing and
investigating the transaction, came to the following
conclusion: That Mr. S——s and his party, instead
of going direct to their boat, did go this way and
that way, and every way but the right way; and on
a certain day, and in a certain lane, did kill, or did
slay, or did murder or put to death several ducks,
and did keep, and did hold, and did maintain the
same, without any right law or title; and for such
conduct Mr. S——s was sentenced to be dismissed
from the Barfleur, and his party to have slops
served out to them at the gangway.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The midshipman
thought this extremely hard, and on leaving
observed that had the case been tried before a jury
he was sure they would have brought in a verdict
of justifiable duckicide.</p>

<p class='c008'>A curious bet took place between our chaplain
and one of the officers. The wager was that the
latter would bring a man who would eat eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>penny rolls and drink a gallon of beer before the
parson could walk a mile. Now the reverend
gentleman was a great pedestrian, and could walk a
mile in less than a quarter of an hour. The ground
being chosen, one began to eat and the other to
walk at the same moment, a gentleman being placed
at each end with watches that corresponded to a
second, when the parson to his utter amazement,
after he had walked three-quarters of his mile, met
the other, who had with ease finished his rolls and
beer, and was unwilling that his reverence should
have the trouble of walking the whole mile and
therefore came to meet him. The reverend gentleman,
like most clergymen, played well at whist, and
once sitting at his favourite game, our signal was
made, and the order was for the chaplain to attend
a man that was to be hanged next morning. This
broke up the game, when one of the officers observed:
‘Doctor, you have lost the odd trick; but
never mind, the fellow you are going to attend has
got nothing by honours.’</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>QUEEN, 98</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now green in youth, now with’ring on the ground;</div>
      <div class='line'>Another race the following spring supplies,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In this ship I found a new race of men, all strangers
to me with the exception of five. I was recommended
to Captain Hutt, commanding the Queen, 98,
fitting in Portsmouth Harbour, by my late friend
Admiral Bourmaster, and joined her early in 1793.
I had not been long on board when I was ordered
with a party of seamen to fit out the Conflagration
fireship, Lieutenant Laurie (now Sir Robert)
superintending. Having received orders to fit for
foreign service, we proceeded to Spithead and
hoisted the flag (blue at the mizen) of Rear-Admiral
Gardner, and having rigged the Conflagration returned
to our ship. The Queen being ordered to
the West Indies, I made (like a fool) application to
Captain Bourmaster to get me removed to the
Berwick, 74, commanded by Sir John Collins,
Knight, fitting for the Mediterranean, to which
place I wished much to go. After long consideration
he agreed to my request; at the same time
observing that I stood in my own light and that I
would lose promotion by taking such a step. This
I well knew; but the hatred I had for the West
Indies made me blind to my own interest. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>I saw Captain Hutt I found it no easy matter to
bring him to my way of thinking, and it was a long
time before he would give his consent. I remember
when he sent for me in his cabin, I fell over a
small case that happened to be in the way and broke
my shins, for which he called me a damned clumsy
fellow and said I deserved what I got for wishing
to leave the ship, and that I would bitterly repent it
when I found others promoted and myself left out.
However, he gave me my discharge and a very good
certificate, shook hands with me and wished me
success. He was one of the strictest officers in the
navy, an excellent sailor, and woe betide those that
were slack in carrying on the duty. He had a
stern look, with a penetrating eye that would pierce
through those who he questioned, and in him the
service lost an officer not easily replaced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant, old Constable, was a devil
of a tyrant. When first I asked him leave to go on
shore for a few hours, he said he would see me in
hell first; and on my thanking him for his kindness,
he swore if I did so again he would try me by a
court martial for my politeness. I was once starting<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
the jolly-boat boys for being slack in getting into
the boat, when old Constable being present and
observing what I was about, ‘Damn my eyes, sir,’
says he, ‘that’s not the way; you should take a
handspike and knock their brains out.’ He was a
good sailor and an indefatigable first lieutenant, but
fractious and disagreeable; yet on shore quite the
reverse. Our second lieutenant, Billy Bedford, was
very particular and fidgety, and would nig-nag all day
long about trifles. We had a very droll midshipman
(George Milner) who would take him off in the most
laughable manner by jumping round a cask, grinning
most horribly and singing Nig-nig-nag and Fidgetyfidgety-fum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>until the tears would start from his
eyes. This was for getting a rub down from Bedford,
who he swore was only fit to be a cooper, and
to jump round a cask.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had many droll and good fellows among our
midshipmen. I shall mention a few; and first,
Flinders (one of the mates) who I messed with in
the main hatchway berth on the lower deck. He
was well acquainted with ancient history and wrote
notes on what he read with sound observations. He
was very fond of a drop, and would expatiate on the
character of Alexander the Great, and said had he
been present at the drinking party, Promachus
would not have won the talent so easy, and he
would have pledged Alexander himself with a bowl
they had in his family against that of Hercules.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack Barrett (who commanded the Minotaur, 74,
when she was lost) was another droll hand, the life
and soul of the ship. He was a most worthy fellow
and departed this life with the character of a brave
and meritorious officer, lamented by a numerous
acquaintance. James McPherson Rice, my worthy
messmate, thou art also gone. A most excellent
fellow, a great mathematician, well read, and respected
by everyone that knew him. Out of the
whole mess I am the only one left—Flinders,
Meager, Milner, etc., etc., etc., all gone; and of
the forty-eight that were on board, thirty-six have
departed for that bourne from whence no traveller
returns, as the following list will show:—</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>BERWICK, 74</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Joined the Berwick in April 1793, Sir John Collins,
Knight, captain, fitting in Portsmouth Harbour for
the Mediterranean, and in May sailed with a
division of the fleet under the Vice-Admiral Lord
Hood, who had his flag on board the Victory, 100.
On the passage the squadron captured a corvette.
We arrived at Gibraltar, Vice-Admiral Hotham’s
Division in company, and having taken in our water
sailed for Toulon. When off Minorca we fell in
with the Spanish fleet under Don Langara on a
cruise. To the best of my recollection our fleet
consisted of twenty sail of the line besides frigates,
but several men of war joined after.</p>

<p class='c008'>[The list of the fleet which follows has no
authority, and has been frequently printed.]</p>

<p class='c008'>When near Toulon Lord Hood made the signal
to prepare for battle, and also the signal for a
general chase which ended in the capture of the
corvette L’Éclair. Saw the enemy’s fleet at anchor
in the inner and outer roads. When sent in to reconnoitre,
they would allow us to come as near as we
liked; but the moment the ship was put about their
forts would blaze away with red-hot shot; and we in
the Berwick had nearly got into an awkward situation,
which I shall speak of hereafter. In July
while cruising off Toulon the fleet encountered a
tremendous gale, and the old Berwick, who always
bore the name of a bad sea boat, proved it on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>occasion with a vengeance. First the bowsprit went,
about two feet before the outer gammoning; bore up,
and got the runners and tackles forward to secure the
foremast. At daylight made the signal of distress,
and parted company from the fleet. The rigging
being new, it became so slack that we were obliged
to set it up, with a very heavy sea running, which
was done in a seaman-like manner; but mark what
follows. After the lower rigging was set up,
and while before the wind, the main sail, of all sails
in the world, was set, and the ship hove to slap at
once, by which she was nearly thrown on her
beams ends. The main yard went in the slings,
the main topmast and half the main top carried
away, the fore mast sprung in two places, and
the mizen mast in three; of the main-top men of
one watch, seventeen in number, one was killed,
another drowned, and several of the others severely
hurt, but by falling on the splinter netting were
fortunately saved. The wreck of the main yard
had nearly knocked two ports into one on the main
deck, while that of the main topmast got under the
counter, damaged the copper, and had almost unshipped
the rudder before it could be cleared, which
was done with great difficulty. It is a fact that the
ship rolled sixteen or eighteen feet of her fore yard
in the water,<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and laboured so dreadfully that on our
arrival in port the oakum was found to have worked
so much out of the seams, particularly under the
counter, that it was astonishing we succeeded in
reaching Gibraltar. I must also mention that the
force of the wind was so great that it burst the
lashings<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a> of the jolly boat lying on the booms, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>blew the boat away like a feather. So much for the
Gulf of Lyons. I do not mean to throw blame on
any one, but I cannot help thinking that the ship
was somehow or other badly handled, to say nothing
of her being a bad sea boat; and if she had not
been as strong as wood and iron could make her,
must certainly have paid a visit to Davy Jones’
locker.</p>

<p class='c008'>We remained at Gibraltar several weeks in the
New Mole, and enjoyed ourselves by going up to
the old Porter house on Scud Hill<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> of an evening,
and sometimes to the Junk Ships and the Swan;
and then cruise about the town, which is not
deficient in places of amusement. It was here I
first observed the march of intellect; a fellow, whose
name was Anthony Strico and kept a wine house,
had over his door in large letters,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the ship was refitted we proceeded to join
the fleet at Toulon which had surrendered to Lord
Hood during our absence. While off Minorca we
were taken in a thundering squall that had almost
done for the old Berwick a second time. Next day,
fell in with a Spanish frigate dismasted; gave her
some assistance which she seemed to want, as they
appeared to be deficient in nautical knowledge, or,
in other words, the vilest set of lubbers that ever
were seen. They positively did not know how to
get a jury mast up. On our arrival at Toulon we
found Lord Hood with the British fleet and Don
Langara with the Spanish; also some Neapolitan
men of war. Landed our soldiers, which were part
of the 69th regiment of foot doing duty as marines.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Plenty of fighting going on in every direction, the
Princess Royal and some other ships keeping up a
constant fire against the enemy’s lines to prevent
them throwing up batteries. We had some pleasant
trips in our launch in carrying a load of eighteen
and thirty-two pound shot to supply the Princess
Royal while she was engaging, the shot from the
enemy flying more than half a mile beyond us.
Fortunately we escaped without injury. One of the
lower-deck guns on board the Princess Royal or
St. George—I forget which—burst and killed nine
men and wounded twenty-seven.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a> We remained but
a short time at Toulon, and then sailed to join
Commodore Linzee at Tunis.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a delightful passage running along the
Italian shore with a fine view of Elba, Gorgona,
Pianoza, Monte Christo, Capraja, etc.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Stood over for Sardinia and put into Cagliari,
the capital, where we found Commodore Linzee
and squadron.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>October 22, 1793.</em>—Went on shore and dined in
company with the Sardinian admiral and several
great men of the island, who were very intelligent
and gave us an account of the attack made by the
French squadron, who were beaten off with loss
(according to their account) of 5,000 men.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Visited
the city, which has a university, and went to some
of the convents to purchase articles from the nuns.
Found the friars a set of jolly fellows who behaved
to us with great civility, not only in this place but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in every other port in the Mediterranean that we
put into.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>October 25.</em>—Sailed from Cagliari in quest of
some French frigates, but had not the good fortune
to fall in with them. During the cruise before we
put into Cagliari and joined the commodore, we fell
in with six sail of the line who, not answering the
private signal, were taken for a French squadron.
It being late in the evening we made all sail and
stood from them; they gave chase the whole of the
night, but only two could come up with us, and
they took good care not to come alongside, and
well for them they did not; all our guns were
loaded with round and double-headed shot, and our
68-pounders on the forecastle were crammed with
grape and canister, and our fellows (two thirds of
them Irish) were determined to give them a lesson
that would never be forgotten. This they seemed
to anticipate, as they kept hankering on the quarter
until morning, when they hoisted Spanish colours;
one of them sent a boat on board of us.</p>

<p class='c008'>The officer seemed astonished when he saw our
men at quarters, their black silk handkerchiefs<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a> tied
round their heads, their shirt sleeves tucked up, the
crows and handspikes in their hands, and the
boarders all ready with their cutlasses and tomahawks,
that he told Sir John Collins they put him
in mind of so many devils.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the cruise we put into Tunis, and found
lying there the Duquesne, French 74; and higher
up in the bay, near the Goletta, her convoy, consisting
of fifty sail of merchantmen with valuable
cargoes; also the Spanish squadron mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>above. Commodore Linzee with the following
men of war anchored close to the Frenchman, and
the Agamemnon near their convoy:—</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here mention that the Yankee-doodle<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
James in his <cite>Naval History</cite> takes no notice of this
expedition, which is to be wondered at as the ‘Sea
Serpent’ was never backward in finding fault, and
here he missed a good opportunity. The Agamemnon
and Lowestoft were sent, as I have stated, to
watch the convoy, and the three seventy-fours
anchored one abreast, another on the bow, and one
on the quarter of the Duquesne, ready to bring her
to action, and six sail of the line (Spanish) to assist
in this great undertaking; but all this mighty preparation
came to nothing. The cargoes were safely
landed from the convoy; and the Duquesne, after
laughing at us for several weeks and singing the
Marseilles hymn morning and evening, with the
English jack spread over her round house, got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>under way, and arrived safe at Toulon, which had
been evacuated by the fleet and army; and all this
because Tunis was a neutral port. Now everybody
knew that before the squadron sailed, and also that
Tunis was nothing less than a nest of thieves;
besides, we were out of gunshot of their forts and
might have taken the whole with the greatest ease
imaginable.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a rugged-headed, squint-eyed boatswain’s
mate, who early one morning passed the
word for all those who were quartered on the main
deck to come below and fight the lower-deck guns.
He was instantly obeyed, and the people of their
own accord were absolutely going to bring the
French 74 to action, and the above boatswain’s mate
as the head of the party was in the act of setting the
example, when the second lieutenant snatched the
match out of his hand just as he was going to fire.
Lord Nelson, who commanded the Agamemnon,
happened to come on board soon after, and when
this was told him he seemed quite pleased: ‘For
then,’ says he, ‘we must have taken them.’ If he
had commanded, we certainly should have taken
them,<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and not have stayed wasting our time for
months in the bay doing nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our squadron used to water near the Goletta, a
small channel leading to the ancient harbour of
Carthage, fortified on each side and a chain across.
On the left of this channel they have a gun with
marble shot of immense size; the diameter of the
bore twenty two inches and a half. On the other
side are a few wells dug in the sand, from which the
squadron got their water. On one occasion I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>in the launch to fill our casks, a messmate of mine
(the present Captain Valobra) taking a trip with me;
having given directions about filling, I proposed to
cross the Goletta (which has a drawbridge over it)
and take a look at the large fort they have close by.
On getting into the interior, which is a square, we
saw a door open and went into what appeared a
guard room, from the number of arms tastefully
arranged about the walls, and several Turks rolled
up in blankets lying on the floor. Having examined
the place we were going away, when one of the
Turks, as I approached the door, caught hold of me
by the collar and pushed me back. I did not relish
this and tried to make the blackguard understand,
but all to no purpose. However, I again made a
movement to get out, when a young Turk, with a
short stick that had something round like a ball
fixed to the end of it, made a blow at my head
which would certainly have done for me had I not
stepped back in time. We had left our side arms
in the launch and had nothing to defend ourselves
against this ruffian. One of the Turks we heard
say ‘Spagniolle!’ upon which Valobra called out
‘Angleise!’ Whether this had the effect to liberate
us I know not; but an old withered Turk came up,
and after a deal of altercation with the fellow who
struck at me, he pointed to the door and showed us
the way out, and glad enough we were of it.
Having filled our casks we returned on board (the
rascally Turks pelting us with stones as long as we
were in reach), and made a complaint to Sir John
Collins, who went on shore the next day to represent
the business to the commandant of the fort, and this
vagabond had the impudence to say we might think
ourselves well off that we were not sent up the
country and made slaves. Went with Lieutenant
Shirley to see the ruins of Carthage.... Saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>several remains of antiquity, broken columns,
underground passages, pieces of frieze, and the
remarkable arches supposed to be the stables of the
elephants. I went into a room like a cellar and got
a piece of the flooring, of beautiful green and white
marble, which I brought home; but some thief in
England stole it from me—the devil do him good
with it. The ground about the ruins was covered
with reptiles of almost every description, which
made it dangerous to explore. I carried a piece of
frieze several miles intending to bring it home also,
but was obliged to leave it from fatigue. As Lieutenant
Shirley, who was very tired, sat on a broken
column, I observed it might have been the same
that Caius Marius rested on when in exile and from
which he made this memorable reply (to show the
instability of human greatness) to him that was sent
by the governor to warn him off: ‘Go,’ says he,
‘and say that thou hast seen Caius Marius sitting
on the ruins of Carthage.’</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time before we left Tunis the bey sent
a present to the squadron, of bullocks, butter, poultry,
scented candles and some otto of roses. We in the
cockpit had some butter, poultry, and a scented
candle or two; as for the otto of roses we could
smell it near the wardroom, but not a drop could we
see in the cockpit. However, we were more regaled
with the scent of a seapie, made in a pitch kettle
that contained, besides other delicacies, upwards of
thirty fowls. We sat round the cauldron in the
cockpit, like the witches in ‘Macbeth,’ and would not
have exchanged this glorious mess for all the otto of
roses belonging to the bey or his ministers. At the
same time, the devil thank some people for their
kindness in not paying the compliment; they might
have sent us one small bottle to counteract the bilge
water; but never mind; they, poor souls, are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>dead; and most of us are alive notwithstanding.
As for the butter, it was only fit to grease the topmasts,
and for that purpose we resigned it. We had
a few of the candles, made of beeswax and scented.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bullocks were very small, and here I must
relate a droll circumstance. Our purser’s steward
was one that dearly loved grog, and it so happened
that on the day the bullocks were slaughtered, he
got beastly drunk. Some of the midshipmen seeing
him in that situation in the first watch, lying near
the steward room, agreed to sew him up in one of
the bullocks’ hides, which was accordingly done.
The horns being on, were fixed to a nicety on his
head and fastened under the chin, firm as a rock.
A little before twelve he came to himself and got up
(for his legs and arms were free) and tried to get
into the steward room, but the key was secured.
He then began to bellow, just as the quartermaster
came down to call the watch, and was knocking his
horns against the bulk head, his tail near the cockpit
ladder. The quartermaster, holding up his
lantern, looked at him for some time in amazement;
at last, letting it fall, he took to his heels, swearing
that the devil was in the cockpit; while those who
slept abaft on the lower deck jumped out of their
hammocks and followed his example. ’Twas a
most laughable sight; particularly so when the
officer of the watch came down to see what was
the matter and, evidently under the influence of
fear, did not venture down the cockpit ladder until
one of the midshipmen came up and said it was
Colquhoun, the steward, transformed into a bullock.
It had a good effect on the steward, as he was afraid
ever after to bouse his jib up; and whenever he
put his head up the cockpit ladder, those on the
lower deck would sing out, ‘What’s become of your
horns?’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Left Tunis for Porto Farino to get a supply of water
for the fleet. The plague had made great ravages
before our arrival, but had in some measure abated.
This place is a Turkish arsenal, and several of their
men of war were fitting out. A number of Neapolitan
slaves were at work in the different storehouses;
some of them could speak English, and
gave us an interesting account of the conduct of
their masters. I saw an old Turk, upwards of
seventy, with a long stick in his hand thrashing
several of the poor wretches. I could not refrain
from telling him he was a damned old scoundrel;
whether he understood or not, I cannot say, but he
called out repeatedly, ‘Esau, Esau’; and Lieutenant
Shirley bawling in his ear, ‘Will you have
Isaac and Jacob also?’</p>

<p class='c008'>Porto Farino is situated near the mouth of the
Bagrada,<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> where Attilius Regulus, the Roman consul,
lay encamped in the first Punic war, when the
serpent attacked and destroyed several of his
soldiers who came to the river to obtain water.... The
ancient city of Utica, famous for the death of
Cato in the civil war, was at no great distance from
this port.</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time before we sailed the Turkish
governor paid a visit to the ship, with his retinue,
among whom was the Turkish admiral—a fine looking
fellow near seven feet high. We saluted the
governor with eleven guns, and he minutely inspected
every part of the ship and seemed highly
delighted with the bread room, and also with the
68-pounders we had on the forecastle. One of his
attendants spoke English, and said he was in England
at the time the Foudroyant was captured by
the Monmouth,<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and that he lived at Wapping.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>We suspected he was an Englishman although he
said his name was Mustapha.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sailed from this port to cruise off the Island of
Pantalaria. You that are fond of romance are
aware that in this island the famous captain of
banditti met his death; all Italy speaks of him,
from the Apennines to the Straits of Messina, and
the shepherds of the Sicilian vales sing the praises
of the valoroso Capitano Rinaldini. But they did
not (in this island) sing the praises of little Tommy
Yates, our purser, who went on shore to purchase
some articles, and put the whole island under quarantine
when they found out we had just left the
Turkish port; and if Tommy had gone on shore
the second time he probably would have left his
bones there.</p>

<p class='c008'>We encountered off this island the heaviest gale
I ever was in; particularly a squall that lasted from
seven bells in the middle watch until two bells
in the morning watch. The storm staysails were
blown from the bolt rope, and the ship during this
prodigious gust lay with her main deck guns in the
water. The sea was one white sheet, and during
the whole course of my servitude I never witnessed
anything equal to it; and many who had been in
the hurricane of 1780 in the West Indies, declared
that this squall was equally terrible. After the
cruise we put into Trapani, the ancient Drepanum.
It was here Aeneas landed, according to Virgil,
when the fight with the gauntlet took place between
Dares and Entellus, and it was also famous for that
between Hercules and Eryx, in which the latter
was killed. It was a noted place in the first Punic
war for military events, as that of the defeat of the
Roman fleet under the Consul Claudius Pulcher,
wherein (according to Valerius Maximus) the Romans
lost 90 galleys, 8,000 men killed or drowned, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>20,000 taken prisoners by the Carthaginians without
the loss of a man or a single galley on their
side.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I must here relate an anecdote which will show
how careful people ought to be when joking with
those whom they think don’t understand their language.
The day after we arrived at Trapani, near
thirty Sicilian clergymen came on board to see the
ship, and while on the quarter deck making their
observations, Palmer, our fourth lieutenant, in a
frolicsome mood, went up to one of them and, while
bowing and scraping, said, ‘Pray, sir, were you
ever knocked down with a fathom of ——?’ when,
to Palmer’s horror and amazement, the other
answered in good English, ‘Never in my life, sir,’
and then addressed his companions, who cast their
eyes upon Palmer and began to laugh at his expense.
This he could not stand, and in going
down the quarter deck ladder declared he would
sooner face the devil than a Trapani parson.</p>

<p class='c008'>The islands Maretimo, Levanzo, and Faviguano
are near this place; in the last-mentioned island the
Turkish prisoners are sent as slaves. We saw
several of them at work in the moat, one of them a
man of prodigious stature. These islands were the
ancient Ægades, where Lutatius Catulus, the Roman
consul, defeated the Carthaginian fleet and put an
end to the first Punic War.<a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Before we left Trapani we went to see a church,
or rather cemetery, where several rows of dead
bodies were placed in niches one over the other.
They were naked, some standing up and others
lying at full length, and presenting an appearance
truly horrible; we understood they belonged to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>particular order. While lying here, a mutiny took
place among the ship’s company, in consequence of
some bullocks that were anything but fat being sent
for the use of the people. Now John Bull, having
more regard for fat and lean, swore he’d be damned
if he’d have anything to do with skin and bone. A
survey was then held and the report stated that as
no other meat could be obtained, double allowance
of this lean kine should be served out to make up
the deficiency; but all to no purpose; and John
Bull, forgetting his duty and only thinking of his
maw, broke out into open rebellion. Some of the
scoundrels were put in irons, but were immediately
released by the others and the irons thrown overboard.
They then assembled on the lower deck,
got the hammocks down, and a breastwork made
in the bay, with the two foremost guns pointed aft.
The officers at last prevailed on them to return to
their duty, and, Sir John Collins being an easy man,
no examples were made. Sailed for Leghorn, where
we arrived in Carnival time. We were not long at
an anchor before the ship was surrounded by boats
with musicians playing fine Italian airs and women
singing most delightfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several men of war were in the roads; among
which was the Aquilon, 32, with Prince Augustus
Frederick (now Duke of Sussex) on his travels.
Got leave with some difficulty to go on shore with
two messmates, Graves and Valobra; saw the brazen
men so much spoken of, consisting of the father and
three sons (Turks) in bronze chained to the four
corners of a pedestal, with a marble statue of a
Tuscan prince on the top. Visited the Jews’
synagogue, which was well worth seeing, being a
magnificent temple; also the churches, opera house
and many other places, with fine paintings and
statuary, and had glorious fun at the Carnival, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>we met our little purser, Tommy Yates, with a
mask and a black domino on, cutting such capers
that Heraclitus would have wiped away his tears
had he seen him, and joined in the laugh. He was
a wet little soul and generous to a degree, and
everyone respected him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early next morning, after a sumptuous breakfast,
we set off for Pisa, about fourteen or fifteen
miles from Leghorn, in one of the gilt coaches with
horses that, had they seen the devil would not have
taken fright. We were three hours going the
distance and had full time to observe the beautiful
prospect along the Vale of Arno. About ten we
entered Pisa, where they were celebrating the
Carnival in a magnificent style, and we were told
that six hundred coaches were in the procession.
The prince was among the number and appeared
much gratified. Pelting with sugar plums is customary
on this occasion; and one of our midshipmen
pelted Lord Hervey in his coach; and when
told it was the British ambassador, and that he
looked very angry, he immediately hove another
volley at Lady Hervey, observing that she looked
better tempered than his Excellency.</p>

<p class='c008'>We spent a very pleasant evening at the theatre,
and next morning went to the cathedral—a gorgeous
fabric, with gates of bronze highly decorated with
passages from scripture in compartments in <i><span lang="it">basso
relievo</span></i>. We also saw the baptistery with a whispering
gallery, and the <i><span lang="es">campo santo</span></i>, with the paintings
on the wall in <em>fresco</em> round the cloisters, the work
of the oldest masters. One painting I well recollect,
representing the Last Judgment—the work I
believe of Buffalmaco, who in this painting drew
all his friends going to heaven, and his enemies
going to the devil; the faces of all being an exact
resemblance of those of both parties. The tombs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>some of the masters are at the foot of their works.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
The <i><span lang="es">campo santo</span></i> is an oblong figure, and the earth
in the centre was brought from the Holy Land
some centuries ago, and people of religious celebrity
are here interred.</p>

<p class='c008'>We next visited the Observatory and Botanical
Gardens, and then to the top of the Leaning Tower,
187 feet high, and whose summit overlooks the base
fifteen feet. One of our party began ringing the
bells, which brought up a posse of friars; and
Graves, pointing to one of them, a very fat man,
exclaimed, ‘I’ll be damned if that fellow is not fitted
for foreign service with six months’ provisions in his
guts.’ I suppose they did not understand him, as
they behaved with great civility. Some in this
country, who I could mention, would have behaved
in a different manner. There’s an old saying</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That Pisa looks ill</div>
      <div class='line'>If you sit still.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This was not the case with us, as we were constantly
on the move and saw everything and enjoyed
ourselves greatly, particularly among the masks
while parading the Lung’ Arno. The day before
our departure we took a long and delightful walk
upon the banks of the Arno and were within a few
miles of the spot where Catiline and his whole
army were destroyed 63 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, in the consulship of
Marcus Tullius Cicero and Caius Antonius Nepos.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pisa has a university and formerly contained
100,000 inhabitants, but has greatly fallen off and
grass grows in the streets. It contains many
churches and other superb buildings, particularly
the Grand Duke’s palace in the Lung’ Arno, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Hospital, and Exchange. There are three bridges
over the Arno, one of them of marble. Several
Roman antiquities are to be seen. It was our intention
to have gone to Lucca and from thence to
Florence; but all sublunary things are vain, as we
were ordered to sea sooner than was expected, and
returned to Leghorn after five days’ absence, where
we dined at an excellent ordinary at one of the best
houses in the city. We had a strong party of English
officers at the dinner, some of whom got rather
merry before the cloth was off the table, and catching
hold of the waiter they rolled him in the cloth
with plates and dishes, the fellow roaring out all the
while to no purpose. One midshipman took a loaf
and let if fall out of the window (we were on the
second floor) upon the jaw of an Italian in the street,
which floored him, while others pelted legs and
wings of fowls at those looking out of the opposite
windows; but to their kind forbearance everything
was taken as a joke and only laughed at. Would
this have been the case in England?—where every
hole and corner has a board threatening prosecution,
and if you pass two or three stopping in the
street, their conversation will be about law, hanging,
or trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sallied out in the evening and went to a house
in Scratch Alley—you that have been at Leghorn I
daresay know the place well. In the middle of this
lane lived an old woman of enormous size, who was
named the Boatswain of Scratch Alley. Saw a
figure there I never shall forget—a fellow dressed
as a lady, with a fine cap trimmed with blue ribbon
and a white frock on, a face like Vulcan with a long
black beard. When he came in the room we were
sitting in, he danced a fandango and cut such astonishing
capers that my old messmate Vosper said
drily, ‘Gardner, if that fellow is not the devil he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>must be his near relation.’ The next evening three
of us took a cruise, and, it being very late before
we returned, our lodging was shut up and with difficulty
we got entrance to a house near the Mole.
The accommodations vile in the extreme; only one
bed, with sheets as if a sweep had slept in them.
At this time it began to rain with drops as big as
pistol balls, which obliged us to stay where we were.
However, we sat on the chairs, but got very little
sleep for the rats and people passing and re-passing
to a sewer at the end of the room. The morning
luckily turned out fine, and after clearing our
uniforms of a few bugs that thought fit to billet
themselves on us without being invited, we gladly
started from this infernal hotel to breathe the fresh
air. Went to Montenero, where the learned Smelfungus
has a monument near his remains.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Having received orders to sail immediately and
join the squadron under Vice-Admiral Hotham off
Toulon, we first put into St. Fiorenzo for a short
time. Went to see the Mortella tower that beat off
the Fortitude, 74, and Juno frigate; the former ship
had upwards of sixty killed and wounded, and was
on fire in several places from the red-hot shot.
This tower had but two guns; one of them was
dismounted during the attack and defended by
twenty Frenchmen, only one of whom was killed.
The tower was taken by mounting some guns on a
spot that overlooked it.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Sailed from St. Fiorenzo and joined the
squadron. Our captain, Sir John Collins, being ill,
we had Captain William Shield acting. Sir John
soon after departed this life and was committed to
the deep. Sixteen minute guns were fired at the
funeral to denote the number of years he had been
a post captain. Sir John was a well-meaning man,
but fractious from long illness. He died with the
gout in his head and stomach. The ship’s company
paid respect to his memory; they divided their
black silk handkerchiefs,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and wore one part round
their hats and the other round their arms, and requested
they might see the corpse before the interment;
which request was granted, and they walked
through the cabin in ranks and bowed to the coffin
while passing, and most of them in tears—a sight truly
impressive. Billy Shield remained with us about a
month after Sir John’s death, and then George
Campbell, as good a fellow as ever lived, took
command.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already stated our reconnoitring the
enemy’s fleet in the roads. Out of many instances
I shall mention one that had nearly been of serious
consequences. Having stood in with a fine breeze,
the enemy never fired a shot until we hove in stays.
At this time it fell on a sudden a dead calm, and we
were within gunshot. They then began to blaze
away from all their forts, the red-hot shot flying in
every direction. I was looking out of the gunroom
port when a shot came right under our counter,
which made the water hiss and had nearly struck
the rudder. At this time things looked queer, all
the boats were hoisted out and began to tow, but
still we drifted in, the shot flying full half a mile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>beyond us, when luckily a breeze came off the land
and saved the Berwick from being sunk or blown
up, for she never would have been taken. Fortunately
we had none killed or wounded, which was
astonishing, as the shot flew like hail. Captain
Campbell soon after left the ship, being appointed
to the Terrible, 74, and Captain George Henry
Towry succeeded him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our squadron under Admiral Hotham consisted
of eight sail of the line, two of them three-deckers
(the Britannia, 100, and St. George, 98) and two
frigates; and, after several weeks’ cruise, the French
fleet put to sea from Toulon with seven sail of the
line, one of them a three-decker, and six or seven
frigates or smaller vessels. Now, mark me, several
of those ships had been put down as burnt at the
evacuation of Toulon, but now had the impudence
to rise from their ashes like the Phœnix,<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> or like the
snake that had slept the winter, but on the return
of spring appears renewed in youth and with new
fury burns:</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><em>June 1794.</em>—We were at dinner when the drum
beat to quarters, and on going upon deck saw the
‘Resurgam Squadron’ coming out, under topsails
and foresail, on the starboard tack, in line of battle,
the Sans Culotte,<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a> 136 guns, their leading ship; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>wind westerly; our squadron standing in on the
larboard tack, and to the best of my recollection
about three leagues from the enemy; and, had we
stood on and tacked, we should have got in their
wake. But our admiral made a signal—it being at
this time evening—that a movement would take
place after dusk. Now, what do you think this
movement was? Why, to bear up and sail large!
‘Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the streets of
Askalon.’ The Meleager, 32, was left behind to
watch the enemy. All this appeared strange; but
the admiral, we supposed, knew</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What was what and that as high</div>
      <div class='line'>As metaphysic wit could fly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now we had an opinion also, and that opinion
was that the French might have been brought to
action that evening; at any rate we should have prevented
them from getting back to the roads, and
could have attacked them in the morning if a night
action was considered hazardous. It was said the
admiral was fearful they should escape us and throw
relief into Calvi, at that time besieged. Whatever
was the reason, off we set as if hell kicked us and
joined Lord Hood—I think the next day; and then,
as brave as Hercules, crowded sail with fourteen or
fifteen sail of the line and got sight of them the day
after, in the morning, working in near Gourjean
Bay,<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> where they anchored in the afternoon under
the forts. Lord Hood made every preparation to
attack them, and a general chase with some hopes
of success took place. We were ordered to attack
the fort on the starboard hand until the fleet had
passed, and then to follow; and the Illustrious, 74,
was ordered against the frigates in the other quarter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in shore, near the other line-of-battle ships. But all
this ended in disappointment, as towards night the
wind blew strong off the land and the attack was
given up in the morning, and we were detached
with the sick to St. Fiorenzo, and then to Calvi to
assist in the siege. It was here that Lord Nelson
lost his eye and Captain Serocold his life. We
remained but a short time at Calvi and then returned
to St. Fiorenzo. The Yankee historian (James)
gives a very incorrect account of this; in fact, he
says little or nothing about our squadron under
Admiral Hotham when the French put to sea;
which appears strange, as this calumniator always
felt happy in finding fault with naval officers, and
here he missed a good opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>While cruising in the Gulf of Genoa we picked
up parts of the booms belonging to the Ardent, 64,
who had been missing a long time; and from the
appearance of the spars it was evident she was
blown up with all hands,<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a> as nothing has been heard
of her since. It was a sad business that we did not
bring the French to action the day they left Toulon;
the disappointment was bitterly felt by those who
expected prize money and promotion, and here a
glorious opportunity was thrown away in the most
unaccountable manner. For personal bravery
Admiral Hotham stood pre-eminent; but it has been
said he was not fit to command in chief, but very
able as a second. In the American war he greatly
distinguished himself, particularly when he was
commodore on board the Preston, 50, he engaged
and would have taken a French 84,<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>D’Estaing’s squadron, which a gale of wind coming
suddenly on alone prevented; and the public accounts
respecting this action say, ‘Now for the
glory and honour of the British army.’</p>

<p class='c008'>While speaking of the honour of the British
navy, I must say a word or two more about the
seamen and marines. When Lord Hood besieged
Bastia he proposed to General Dundas, who commanded
the troops, to make a joint attack; but the
general thought it too hazardous. Now Lord Hood
had a different opinion,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>and while General Dundas</div>
      <div class='line'>And his eighteen manœuvres sat still on the grass</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>he attacked the place with the seamen and marines
who covered themselves with glory and carried all
the works, and Bastia was obliged to surrender.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having letters of recommendation to Lord Hood
and to Admiral Goodall, I went on board the
Victory and was told by the secretary (McArthur),
that several were before me on the list for promotion;
but if I would take my chance his lordship
would remove me to the Victory immediately. This
I thought would be of little service; and as the
Gorgon, 44, was under orders for England I requested
to be sent on board of her and try my
interest at home. My request being granted,
Captain Towry in the kindest manner recommended
me to Captain Wallis of the Gorgon, which kindness
I shall always remember, and am sorry that
the service has lost by his death so good an officer.
He served with his Majesty<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> in the Andromeda and
Valiant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before leaving the Berwick I must mention a
few droll hands that belonged to her; and first I
shall bring forward old Bell, the mate of the hold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>We pressed him and several mates of merchantmen
out of a cartel from Marseilles to Gibraltar, and put
them on the quarter deck. He was a hard-drinking
man and also a hard-working man. We had a set
on board full of fun; and when old Bell was half
seas over, they used to paint his face with red ochre,
his eyebrows blacked, large moustache, with a
flaxen wig made from the fag ends of the tiller rope;
a cocked hat over all, tied under the chin; his shirt
off and his body painted like an ancient Briton. In
this costume I have seen him chasing the midshipmen
through the tier with a drawn sword, a fit
subject for a pencil like Hogarth’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next to him was old Collier, who drank like a
fish, and when drunk used to sing the Thirty-fourth
Psalm and prognosticate that the ship would founder
with all hands. They used to make fast his shirt
sleeves at the wrist and then haul the shirt over his
head, so that he could not clear his hands. In this
situation he would be powdered and painted, with a
red night cap on his head, and placed alongside of
old Bell, while the whole cockpit would be in a
roar.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a little slovenly surgeon’s mate whose
name was Vag. The midshipmen annoyed him
sadly by calling out Vag-Veg-Vig-Vog-Vug, while
others in a cockney cadence would sing out Wig-Wag-Wog,
which enraged him almost to madness.
I happened to come into the berth where he was
sitting at a time they were calling out as above,
when he, without any provocation on my part,
snatched up the snuffers and with the sharp end
stabbed me in the chest and then run a-muck after
the rest, who were glad enough to steer clear of
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of our lads had a custom of taking an
afternoon’s nap, particularly Graves, who went with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>me to Pisa. The others, always on the watch for
mischief, would clap a spritsail yard upon his nose.
This was done by cutting a notch on the outside of a
piece of hoop and bending it so as to form a forceps
and then put it on the nose like a spring. The first
time it was fixed he started up and swore lustily
that a rat (for we had hundreds of them on board)
had seized him by the nose. On another occasion
some wicked fellow made a curious mark on his
forehead with caustic that remained for several
weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our chaplain was a learned gentleman and
always going on shore to make researches after
antiquities. When we sailed from Toulon he was
left behind; and on making his escape (so we were
told) when the enemy entered, he got upon a wall
where a rope ladder was placed about ten feet high.
When he got on the top the ladder gave way and
he had no means of alighting on the other side, and
was afraid to jump down. In this predicament a
party of French came up and one of them let fly a
stone, which fortunately for him first struck the wall
and then hit him on the hip, and canted him the
right way; and by that means he luckily made his
escape to the boats with little hurt, but damnably
frightened. In the gale of July 1793, when we
carried away our main topmast and half the main
top, an arm chest full of black pieces<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> fell out of the
top with thundering sound upon the quarter deck,
and several of the muskets stuck with their muzzles
in the deck, which bent some of the barrels. Old
Billy Chantrell, our first lieutenant, taking up one of
them, said with a grin, ‘I shall take this home; it
will do when I go a-shooting to kill sparrows round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>a hayrick.’ When it fell it was within an inch of
his head, and he was knocked down with a piece of
the chest which broke through the netting. I
passed a very happy life during the time I belonged
to the Berwick and parted with many valuable
friends with deep regret. Our first lieutenant
(Chantrell), Mr. Chas. Duncan, the master, and
Tomlinson, the clerk, left the ship at the same time
and joined the Gorgon as supernumeraries for a
passage to England; and also two of my old shipmates,
Yetts and Allardice, formerly of the Edgar,
invalided home, which made the Gorgon very agreeable
to me. The following are the names of the
officers:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Sir John Collins</span>, Knt., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A good man but fractious from severe illness; he commanded
the Ruby, 64, detached from the grand fleet at the relief
of Gibraltar, 1782, being one of eight sail of the line sent to
reinforce the fleet in the West Indies. On the passage she captured,
after a smart action, the Solitaire, a French 64, for which
Captain Collins was knighted.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wm. Shield</span>, Esq., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>A retired rear-admiral. [Died 1842.—Marshall, iii. 89.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Geo. Campbell</span>, Esq., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A vice-admiral; a better fellow never existed. [As a
rear-admiral, second in command under Nelson off Toulon
1803–4. Died, admiral and G.C.B., in 1821.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Geo. Henry Towry</span>, Esq., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1808]. In him the service lost a most worthy officer.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>William Chantrell</span>, 1st Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. See Barfleur.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>William Bullock</span>, 2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A commander; well-meaning and droll.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Chas. Stewart</span> [or <span class='sc'>Stuart</span>], 3rd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1814]. A post captain [1796]; gouty and proud.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Nisbet Palmer</span>, 4th Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1811]. He commanded the Alacrity, an 18-gun brig, in the
Mediterranean, and was captured by a French brig of the same
force. In the action Captain Palmer was wounded and died soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>after. James in his <cite>Naval History</cite> [v. 248 <em>seq.</em>] gives a sad account
of this. He says, ‘Capt. Palmer was only wounded in the
finger, that he ordered the colours to be struck to an enemy of
equal force, and that his death was occasioned by a locked jaw.’
In justice to the memory of Captain Palmer it must be recollected
that the Alacrity was weakly manned—a great number of her crew
being absent in prizes. The Yankee historian must have known
this, but he had not the generosity to state it. [James does state
it; but nevertheless comments very severely on the conduct of
Palmer; not unmindful, perhaps, of the fact that by the death of
the captain, he was commanding officer of the Berwick when
captured on March 7, 1795.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Thomas Shirley</span>, 5th Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. Half mad, but good-natured.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Chas. Duncan</span>, Master.</p>

<p class='c019'>A superannuated master attendant; a very good man.</p>

<p class='c018'>[<span class='sc'>John</span>] <span class='sc'>Dodgson</span>, Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A worthy fellow.</p>

<p class='c019'>A Doctor of Divinity; was with Lord Nelson on board the Victory

<p class='c018'>[<span class='sc'>Hector</span>] <span class='sc'>Tause</span>, Gunner.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. Crabbed.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Alex. Mackenzie</span>, Midshipman.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1825]. A post captain. This man, when he was a midshipman,
used to sneak after the lieutenants; when made a
lieutenant, sneaking after the captains, and when made a captain,
was at his old tricks, sneaking after the admirals. Had he lived
to be made a flag officer, he would have sneaked after the devil.—[Marshall,

<p class='c017'>In July 1794 I joined the Gorgon, Captain James
Wallis, at St. Fiorenzo, and after considerable delay
sailed for Gibraltar with the convoy bound for England
under Vice-Admiral P. Cosby, who had his
flag on board the Alcide, 74. The following men

<p class='c008'>We had a very pleasant passage to Gibraltar,
where we remained some time in the New Mole,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>and then started for Cadiz to take in money and to
join the convoy assembling there for England. On
the passage we got on shore a few leagues to the
southward of Cadiz, and had very near taken up
our quarters on the shoals, and, what was remarkable,
a frigate had been sent before us for the
same purpose, but got on shore in this place, and
was obliged to return, and we (being clever) after
laughing at the circumstance, were sent to repair
her errors and went bump on shore on the very
spot. The America, 64, having arrived at Cadiz to
take charge of the convoy, we were put under her
orders, and having got on board the money, sailed
with the convoy for Lisbon.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a passage of near three weeks we arrived
in the Tagus, fortunately the day before a tremendous
hurricane, which blew dead upon the shore,
came on and lasted a considerable time. We remained
several weeks at Lisbon collecting the convoy.
At last when everything was ready we got
under way, I think the latter end of September, the

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>We had a most dreadful passage home, blowing
a gale of wind the whole time with seldom more
sail set than a close-reefed main topsail. The
French squadron that captured the Alexander, 74,
had been on the look-out for us. We had several
French emigrants on board who were in the
greatest tribulation for fear of being taken; and
fortunately for them and for us the Jacobin
squadron got on the wrong scent. I don’t know
how it happened, but some people kept an odd kind
of reckoning, and we had some idea of making the
banks of Newfoundland instead of the British
Channel. However, at last we got to the northward
and westward of Scilly, with the wind at SW;
but it must be understood, to give the devil his due,
that we had not an observation for a long time, and
our dead reckoning was not to be trusted; but at
last we found out by instinct or soundings that we
were not in the right place. Now it so happened
that we were lying-to on the larboard tack, the
wind, as I have stated, at SW, under a close-reefed
main topsail and storm staysails, when in a
thundering squall it shifted to NNW and took us
slap aback. Over she went, with the upper dead-eyes
on the lower rigging in the water, and we
thought she never would right, but the old ship
came to herself again. She was a noble sea boat;
it would have been worth any man’s while to leave
the feast, the dance, or even his wife, to have been
on board this ship in a gale of wind to witness
her glorious qualities. After standing to the southward
for some time until we thought we had got
into 49° 30′ by our dead reckoning, which is the
latitude of mid-channel, we then altered our course
to SEbE½E. I had a presentiment that something
bad was hanging over us, and I went on the fore
topsail yard (I think about 9 at night) to look out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>ahead, the ship scudding at the rate of eleven knots,
which brought to my mind the following lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The fatal sisters on the surge before</div>
      <div class='line'>Yoked their infernal horses to the prow.—<cite>Falconer.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But in this instance they were outwitted, for lo and
behold, after running some time I saw a light right
ahead, which I instantly knew to be Scilly light,
and I called to Captain Wallis, who immediately
hauled the ship off to the southward. If the
weather had not cleared after the squall before mentioned
we should certainly have made the port
where Sir Clowdsiley Shovell took in his last moorings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gale separated the convoy, and in standing
up Channel we had near run on the Bolt Head, but
hauled off just in time. At last we arrived at Spithead,
where a large fleet of men of war were assembled.
Before we came to an anchor we had nearly
run foul of several ships, and I remember the Invincible,
74, hailing us, saying, ‘You have cut my
cable, sir.’ This was not all, for we shaved off the
old Royal William’s quarter gallery, which some
shipwrights were repairing—who had barely time to
save themselves. We were not allowed to anchor
at Spithead, but to proceed to the Motherbank to
perform quarantine on December 4, 1794, after the
most extraordinary voyage that ever took place
since the expedition of the Argonauts. Here I left
the Gorgon and joined the Victory, who I found to
my astonishment at Spithead.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before I quit the Gorgon I must relate a few
things that happened on and before the passage
home. At the time we left Corsica we had forty-seven
French prisoners on board. One of them
could play the violin remarkably well. One morning
on the forecastle, this man was reading to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of his comrades, and having his violin with him, Mr.
Duncan (our late master in the Berwick) requested
him to play <cite>Ça Ira</cite>, which he for some time refused,
being fearful of giving offence. At last he struck
up the Marseilles hymn accompanied by his voice,
which was very good, and when he came to that
part ‘Aux armes, Citoyens, formez vos bataillons,’
etc., he seemed inspired; he threw up his violin
half way up the fore mast, caught it again, pressed
it to his breast, and sung out ‘Bon, Ça Ira,’ in which
he was joined by his comrades.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Fired with the song the French grew vain,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Fought all their battles o’er again,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thrice they routed all their foes; and thrice they slew the slain;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and seemed ready and willing for any mischief.
But our soldiers were called up and the French
were sent below, and not so many allowed to be on
deck at a time.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the passage we were frequently sent as a
whipper-in among the convoy. On one occasion,
a master of a merchantman was rather slack in
obeying the signal and gave tongue when hailed;
upon which Captain Wallis sent the first lieutenant
and myself to take charge of his vessel. It was in
the evening, blowing fresh, with a heavy sea, and
we had great difficulty in getting on board; our
boat cut as many capers as a swing at a fair, and in
returning got stove alongside. We remained all
night on board and had to prick for the softest
plank. When Edgar, the first lieutenant, awoke in
the morning, it was laughable to hear him exclaim,
‘God bass ‘e’ (for he could not say ‘blast ye,’ and for
this he was nicknamed little Bassey) ‘What’s got
hold of me?’ The fact was the night was hot, and
the pitch in the seams waxed warm, and when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>attempted to rise, he found his hair fastened to the
deck and his nankin trowsers also. He put me in
mind of Gulliver when fastened to the ground by the
Liliputians. Captain Wallis having sent for us, we
took this chap in tow. It blew very fresh, and the
wind being fair, we towed him, under double reefed
topsails and foresail, nine knots through the water,
so that his topsails were wet with the spray. The
master would sometimes run forward and hail, saying,
‘I’ll cut the hawser’; and Captain Wallis would
reply, ‘If you do, I’m damned if I don’t sink you,
you skulking son of a bitch; I mean to tow you until
I work some buckets of tar out of the hawser.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Our admiral (Cosby) was a glorious fellow for
keeping the convoy in order, and if they did not
immediately obey the signal, he would fire at them
without further ceremony. While lying at Gibraltar
a Portuguese frigate arrived, and one of our midshipmen
(Jennings, a wag) was sent on board with a
message from Captain Wallis. Having stayed a
long time, the signal was made for the boat, and
when she returned the captain asked Jennings what
detained him. ‘Why, sir, to tell you the truth, saving
your presence’ (for Jennings was a shrewd Irishman),
‘the commanding officer of the frigate was so
busy lousing himself on the hen-coop that I could
not get an answer before.’</p>

<p class='c008'>When we arrived at Cadiz to join the convoy
and to bring home dollars, the merchants used to
smuggle the money off to the ship to avoid paying
the duty; and for every hundred taken on board,
they would give as a premium two dollars and sometimes
two and a half. It was a dangerous traffic,
but very tempting; and some of our officers while
lying there made sixty and others eighty pounds.
On one occasion, my old shipmate, Lieutenant
Chantrell, fell down in the street with six hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>dollars at his back—a moderate load—and sung out
to some of the Spaniards who were looking on,
‘Come here, you sons of ——, and help me up.’
Had they known what he had at his back they
would have helped him up to some purpose; imprisonment
and slavery would have been the punishment.
The manner they carried the dollars was
this. A double piece of canvas made to contain
them in rows, fixed to the back inside the waistcoat,
and tied before. It was to an English hotel
where they were sent to be shipped. This house
was kept by Mr., or rather Mrs., Young, an infernal
vixen, who would make nothing of knocking her
husband down with a leg of mutton or any other
joint she had in the larder, and he fool enough to
put up with it. She used to charge us very high
for our entertainment, which is the case in all
English houses abroad; and if you have a mind to
be treated fairly you must go to a house kept by a
native, who will never impose on you. Having got
a load of dollars to take off, we found our boat had
left the landing place; so we hired a shore boat,
and it appeared their custom house officers had
suspicions, for they gave chase, and it was by
uncommon exertion that we escaped, as they were
nearly up with us when we got alongside. And yet
those very men who would have seized us used to
smuggle. I saw one of them come alongside and
throw into the lower-deck port a bag of dollars
containing, as I understood, a thousand, with a label
on the bag, and then shove off his boat to row
guard and prevent smuggling!</p>

<p class='c008'>At Cadiz there is a beautiful walk with trees,
called the Alameda, much frequented, particularly on
a Sunday. It has three walks for the different grades
of people. I happened to be on shore with some
of our officers on the above day, and taking a stroll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>through the Alameda, we observed several well-dressed
women in a balcony of one of the large
houses that overlooked the walks. When they
caught sight of us, they beckoned, and we went, as
we thought, into the house. On going up two pairs
of stairs without seeing any one, we imagined it was
a trick, when casting my eye to a door that was
partly open, I saw a fellow with a drawn stilletto
ready to make a stab; upon which I called to the
rest to make their retreat as fast as possible. One
of them (a Mr. Crump) was deaf, and I was obliged
to push him downstairs as I could not make him
understand. This was a warning not lost upon us.</p>

<p class='c008'>A droll circumstance happened while at Lisbon.
A party of us had been to see the famous aqueduct
over the valley of Alcantara, and on coming back,
one of them (Tomlinson, of the Berwick) to show
his dexterity jumped on the back of a donkey. He
had on a round jacket and light nankin pantaloons;
the latter he split from clue to earing, and was
obliged to walk to the boat in that situation, and by
way of helping a lame dog over a stile, we took
the longest way, where we had to pass by several
ladies, with his shirt sticking out and every one
laughing at him. He declared to me it was the
most miserable time he ever experienced in the
whole course of his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were one day accosted while walking in
Black-Horse Square, by a genteel-looking young man
who, in broken English, said he would be happy to
show us about the city, which offer was accepted,
though much against my will. As we were walking
through the streets, I observed the people as they
passed us to laugh and point to others and then at
us. At last we met an officer belonging to our
squadron, who asked if we knew the person we had
in company, because, says he, ‘If you don’t I’ll tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>you. He is the noted pimp of Lisbon, and makes
a trade of showing, not only the city, but all the
ladies of easy virtue from the lowest brothel in Bull
Bay to the highest in the upper town.’ This was
quite enough, and we told the fellow to be off, but
he had the impudence to follow us to the boat for
payment, and even got upon the gang board and
was coming in, when Jennings, in his dry way, said
to the bowman, ‘Don’t you see the gentleman is
dusty? Have you no way of rubbing it off?’
winking at the time. Upon this the bowman without
any ceremony pitched him overboard up to his
neck and then shoved off. We met the fellow several
times after, but he took good care to steer clear.</p>

<p class='c008'>I went with Lieutenant Chantrell to dinner at
an ordinary at Lisbon. Among the company were
several Americans. One of the dishes at the
bottom of the table occasioned a dispute that had
nearly terminated in a battle. A Yankee from the
head of the table came and snatched up a beef-steak
pie that an English master of a transport (one of
our convoy) was serving out, and carried it off to
his companions; upon which the Englishman stood
up and harangued his countrymen as follows: ‘I
say, if you stand this you ought to be damned, and
may as well take a purser’s shirt out of the rigging.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
Now, I move that all you that are Englishmen shall
rise from the table and throw the Yankees out of
the window.’ This speech had the same effect as
that of Nestor’s to the Greeks, and the Yankees
would for a certainty have been thrown into the
street, had not Lieutenant Chantrell requested them
to forbear, observing that abuse was innocent where
men were worthless. This had the desired effect;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and the pie being restored to its place in rather a
diminished state, and the Yankee who took it away
saying he only meant it in Har-mo-ny, the war was
put an end to, and the dinner ended in peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of our men having deserted, I was sent with
Ducker, the boatswain, and a couple of marines to
hunt in Bull Bay, which is the Wapping of Lisbon,
and after a long search we found him and were returning
to the boat. In passing through one of
their dirty streets, something which shall be nameless
was hove out of a window and fell upon the
shoulder of Ducker, about the size of a large epaulette.
I wished him joy of his promotion and told
him that he looked extremely well in his new
uniform. A piece of the same material fell on his
nose and stuck out like the horn of a rhinoceros. I
never saw a fellow so vexed. He was going to
break the windows, but I told him to consider, as
Bull Bay was not to be attacked too hastily. I had
hardly made the observation when his foot slipped,
and he fell back in the gutter, where he lay cursing
the whole race of Portuguese. Then</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Vigorous he rose; and from the effluvia strong</div>
      <div class='line'>Imbibed new strength, and scoured and stunk along.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I thought I should have died a-laughing, while he
was cursing every native he met with until he got
to the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I have stated before, every ship has strange
characters, and the Gorgon had her full share. I
shall begin with the captain, who was a very good
seaman and had many good qualities, but at times
he appeared half mad. He once said to me, pointing
to Ducker, the boatswain, on the forecastle, ‘I’ll
hang that fellow; and you go down directly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>take an inventory of his stores.’ I could hardly
keep my countenance, but went forward, and as the
captain turned his back I said to Ducker, ‘You are
going to be hanged, and I am sent for a piece of
white line to tuck you up genteelly.’ On my reporting
progress, he seemed to have forgot that he
gave such an order, and, taking a pinch of snuff,
merely said, ‘Let the fellow go to hell, and say no
more about him.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The first lieutenant, Edgar, was another strange
and unaccountable being. He had sailed round the
world with Cook, and was master of the ship Captain
Clerke commanded. He was a good sailor
and navigator, or rather had been, for he drank
very hard, so as to entirely ruin his constitution.
He and the captain often quarrelled, particularly at
night. I have heard the captain say, ‘Edgar, I
shall get another first lieutenant.’ The other would
answer, ‘Ye-ye-ye-yes, sir, another first lieutenant.’
The captain again, ‘Edgar, you are drunk.’ ‘No,
sir, bass me if I am.’ A day or two before we left
Corsica, the captain ordered the sails to be bent
and went on shore to St. Fiorenzo. On coming on
board late at night he asked Edgar if the sails were
bent. This question Edgar could not answer, his
memory having failed him; and on the captain asking
him again, he said, ‘Bass me if I know, but I’ll
look up,’ forgetting it was dark. ‘You need not do
that,’ says the other, ‘for damn me if you can see a
hole through a grating.’ Then taking a pinch of
snuff, part of which blew into Edgar’s eye, he asked
him down to supper. This the other readily agreed
to, but said, Bass him, if he could see the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must now speak of Jerry Hacker, the purser.
He was a man, take him all in all, ye ne’er will see his
like again. He messed by himself in the cockpit,
and would sit in his cabin in the dark with a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>stick in his hand, calling out to everyone that came
down the cockpit ladder, ‘What strange man is
that?’ He was in constant fear of being robbed or
cheated, and lived in the most miserable manner.
I have known him to corn meat in his hand-basin
and in something else. He was suspicious to a
degree and always saying he should be ruined,
though there was little fear of that, as Jerry took
good care to trust no one; and what he was only
charged two shillings a gallon for, he kindly offered
to let me have for five shillings, paying ready
money; but I was not to be taken in so easy. He
could not bear the sight of a midshipman in the
cockpit, and did everything in his power to annoy
them, and before I joined the ship, he used to sing
a verse of an old song reflecting on the midshipmen.
One morning while I was in the cockpit, he
was quarrelling with some of them, and then struck
up his favourite air, not thinking that any person
knew the song but himself. However, in this he
was mistaken, and when he had finished the following
verse, I struck up another that settled him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>After hearing the last verse Jerry’s ‘heavenly
voice was heard no more to sing,’ and he looked
with an evil eye upon me ever after.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the gale of wind near the Channel, when we
were taken aback in the squall that I have mentioned,
every article we had was broken with the
exception of the cover of a very large mess teapot.
This we handed round as a measure to one another
with wine from a black jack. I remember being at
supper soon after the squall, in the midship berth in
the cockpit, the ship rolling gunwale under, when
we heard a noise in the after-hold like the rush of
many waters, and it struck everyone that a butt end
had started and that we should founder in a few
minutes. The alarm was given immediately. The
sick and lame left their hammocks; the latter forgot
his crutch, and leaped—not exulting—like the
bounding roe. Down came the captain and a
whole posse of officers and men. The gratings
were instantly unshipped, and in rushed the carpenter
and his crew, horror-struck, with hair standing
on end, like quills on the fretful porcupine;
when, behold, it was a large cask of peas that had
the head knocked out, and the peas as the ship
rolled rushed along with a noise exactly like that of
water.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After looking at one another for some time the
following ludicrous scene took place, which I was
an eye-witness to:—</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain shook his head, took snuff, and went
upon deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Edgar, first lieutenant, followed, and said
‘God bass ‘e all.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Billy Chantrell gave a grin, and damn’d his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carpenter said ‘Damn and b—— the

<p class='c008'>Old Jerry Hacker, the purser, swore he was
ruined, as no allowance would be made him; and
cursed the field the peas grew in; and the French
emigrant captain (Dubosc) said ‘it was as vel for
him to stay at de Toulon and be guillotined, as to
come to dis place and be drowned in de vater.’</p>

<p class='c008'>I never shall forget this scene as long as I live.
I dined with Captain Wallis the next day, and he
asked me, in a very knowing manner, if he should
help me to some peas soup.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our gunner was one of the drollest fellows I
ever met with—it was his delight to come on the
forecastle in the first watch and sing comic songs to
amuse the midshipmen assembled there. ‘Arthur
O’Bradley’ was one that he used to sing with a
great deal of humour. I believe it contained forty
verses. ‘Bryan O’Lynn’ was another which I
shall relate, leaving out the lines that may not be
liked by those endued with fine feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have left out four verses as being rather out of
order. I have heard the old gunner sing this when
the sea has been beating over the forecastle and the
ship rolling gunwale under. We used to get a tarpaulin
in the weather fore rigging as a screen, and
many a pleasant hour have I passed under its lee,
with a glass of grog and hearing long-winded
stories. Alas! how dead are times now. Captain
Wallis behaved very kindly to me. I used to dine
with him two or three times a week. He had, as I
have stated, strange whims and few men are without
them, but his many good qualities threw
them in the background, and I have, with grateful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>remembrance and respect for his memory, to be
thankful for his kindness, and particularly for the
certificate he gave me on leaving the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>Madame Trogoff, the French admiral’s widow,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
came to England and was a passenger in his cabin.
She was a very agreeable woman. We had several
French officers (emigrants) who had left Toulon at
the evacuation. They were in the greatest tribulation
all the passage for fear of being taken. We
had also many invalids from the fleet, of very little
service had we met with an enemy; and our effective
complement I think mustered under a hundred,
so that we should have stood but a poor chance had
we met with the squadron that I have already mentioned.
The forty-seven French prisoners that we
had with us were left at Gibraltar, which was a
great relief to the emigrants we had on board, as
they were in constant fear of their taking the ship
from us. The following are the names of the
officers:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>James Wallis</span>, Esq., Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead [1808]. He had strange ways, but was an able officer and
seaman. [Commander, 1794; captain, 1797. He was therefore
only acting in the Gordon.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Thomas Edgar</span>, 1st Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A commander; was master of Captain Clerke’s ship with
Cook round the world.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Thomas Lyne</span>, 2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>A commander; a very good fellow.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wm. Chantrell</span>, Supy. Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. See Barfleur and Berwick.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wm. Brett</span>, Supy. Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A commander; a good fellow.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span><span class='sc'>[John] Chissell</span>, Master.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A strange fellow; he could speak six or seven different
languages fluently, and was well known in every part of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Jerry Hacker</span>, Purser.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. I believe Jerry was broke. The most strange and unaccountable
fellow the world ever produced.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[William] Philps</span>, Gunner.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. One of the drollest fellows I ever met with.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[John] Ducker</span>, Boatswain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. Much respected.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[James] Jezard</span>, Carpenter.</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncertain. A good timber head of his own.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>[William] Poole</span>, Clerk.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. Very good abilities, but killed by grog.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Ulick Jennings</span>, Midshipman.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. Was captain [commander] of the Woolwich, 44 [store-ship],
but broke by court martial [1, 2 Dec. 1803] at Jamaica, for
thrashing some of the officers of the dockyard. Said to have
been reinstated. A very droll fellow and great mimic. He was
in the Dutch action under Duncan [<em>cf.</em> James, ii. 80, 88], and
blown up; his face terribly scarred. Before that he was a very
good-looking fellow. A native of Ireland, possessing great
personal courage. [There was no thrashing, nor threat of
thrashing, but much insulting and domineering conduct. He was
found guilty of ‘drunkenness and unofficer-like and irregular
behaviour,’ and dismissed the service. He was not reinstated.]</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Richard Chissell</span>, Midshipman; son of the master.</p>

<p class='c019'>Dead. A lieutenant. [Borne as A.B.; native of Leghorn,
aged 20.]</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Bricknell</span>, Supy. Midshipman.</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncertain. The ugliest fellow the world ever produced. He
used to dress with gold-laced hat, silk stockings, and full uniform
upon every occasion, as if going to the queen’s drawing room.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>James Courage</span>, Assistant Surgeon.</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncertain. A fractious little fellow.</p>

<p class='c017'>In such a season, unexampled for severity, I joined
the Victory in December 1794, in Portsmouth
harbour, fitting for the Mediterranean and to receive
again the flag of Lord Hood; John Knight, Esq.,
captain. Had I joined her in St. Fiorenzo Bay
at the time I have before stated, I should have
been promoted, as those who were before me and
many that came after got their commissions as
lieutenants; so by this I lost about five months’
rank, and was obliged to go to London to pass my
examination, as passing abroad is of no use unless
you get promotion on the spot. On my representing
to the first lieutenant (Hamilton) that I
intended to apply to Captain Knight for permission
to go and pass, and requesting him to forward my
application, he in the most unhandsome manner
said he would do no such thing, and would protest
against my getting leave.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now without flattering myself, I thought I knew
the service (without being a conjuror) as well as
Lieutenant Hamilton; and although he said it was
his intention to send me on board the Commerce de
Marseilles to assist in fitting her out at Spithead
(notwithstanding that my right arm was hurt and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>obliged to wear it in a sling), I wrote to Captain
Knight on the subject, who immediately granted my
request. On my stating this to Lieutenant Hamilton,
he said he should still oppose it, adding with a
sneer that my promotion he supposed would not be
so rapid as I expected. Without taking notice of
his remarks I went on shore to take my place in the
coach, and on my return the next morning to get
my things I found that the ship had gone into dock,
and that my chest, and that of another gentleman’s
who had lately joined, had not been removed to the
hulk, but left in the ship, where it was broke open,
and everything I possessed, with the exception of
my quadrant, stolen. The other poor fellow suffered
the same misfortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a heart-breaking circumstance to me,
as I had just fitted myself out, and, with what I
brought home, my loss was considerable. I had
nothing left but what I stood in, and most of my
pay that I received for the Berwick was expended.
My messmates said they were very sorry for the loss
I had sustained. Instead of being sorry, they ought
to have been ashamed of their gross neglect. One
of them had been in the Barfleur with me, and if
possible, was more to blame than the rest who were
strangers. I am not vindictive, but from that day
to this I have hated the sight of a Portsmouth dockyard
man. I had little time and less money to get
fitted out again before the examination took place,
which was early in January; so up to London I
went ‘with a heart rather sad.’ I had on a mate’s
coat, a red waistcoat and grey trowsers, in which
costume I passed my examination. I was so down
in spirits before I went in that I made sure I should
be turned back. My old and lamented friend and
messmate, the late Captain Eaton, went with me
and positively pushed me into the room where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>commissioners were seated, saying, ‘Damn your
eyes,<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Tony, what are you afraid of?’</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the commissioners (Harmood) was an
intimate friend of my father’s; and Sir Samuel
Marshall, the deputy comptroller of the navy, was a
particular friend of Admiral Parry, my mother’s
uncle. To these I was recommended; but notwithstanding
I could not get the better of my dread,
until Commissioner Harmood, after a few questions
had been put to me, said, ‘I think we need not
ask any more.’ Captain Clayton, another of the
commissioners, in reply said, ‘I shall merely ask one
question more. You have a close-reefed main topsail
set, blowing a gale of wind; you cannot carry
it. Pray, sir, how will you take it in, without
splitting the sail?’ Having answered this, but not
exactly to his satisfaction, as I started the weather
sheet first, and he the lee one, I was told they had
done with me, and glad enough I was; particularly
so, when they said the certificates I produced ought
to get me a commission without interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this hint I transmitted them the next day to
Earl Spencer, the first lord of the admiralty. This
was on the 9th January 1795, and I returned to
Portsmouth on the 14th; but before I went on
board I took a stroll in the dockyard, where I met
two old messmates, the late Captains Lamb and
Wolridge, and on my asking them for news, they
said they had just left the commissioner’s office and
had heard nothing. However I thought I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>just call at the office and take a look, and on
my entering the hall where the letters are placed on
a table, the first I observed was directed to
Lieutenant J. A. Gardner, H.M. ship Victory. I
looked at it several times, rubbed my eyes and
looked and looked again at what I thought an
illusion; but I found what I considered shadow to
be substance; for on opening the letter it ran thus:
‘That Earl Spencer had received my memorial on
the 11th, and that my appointment as lieutenant had
passed the board on the 12th January.’ This eased
my mind of a load, and my prospects, that were dark
and dismal from the loss I had sustained, brightened
up, and with a light heart I waited on Captain
Knight to thank him for granting me leave and
to show him my letter. He wished me joy and
expressed great indignation at the loss of my
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here state that, besides what I brought
home from abroad, I lost twenty new shirts, two
suits of uniform, trowsers, waistcoats, boots, etc.,
etc., in fact everything but my quadrant; and that
no doubt would have gone also, but my name was
engraved on the brass.</p>

<p class='c008'>On my return to the Victory to report myself,
Lieutenant Hamilton was all politeness. I was
asked down to the wardroom, and Lieutenant Vincent,
who had been a midshipman with me in the
Salisbury, but who had hardly spoken to me before,
forgot his pomposity and was as friendly as in times
of old; but I disdained their kindness as well as the
dinner they asked me to, and went on shore without
taking leave of the men who suffered, by base neglect,
an absent messmate to be plundered by rascally
dockyard men. I was so short a time on board the
Victory that I remember but few, and a great number
were on leave who I never saw. Some of those in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the mess I knew little of, and only remember the
names of four.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the Victory ends my servitude of mate
and midshipman, but I never can forget the many
happy days I passed in that capacity. It was some
time before I knew what ship I was appointed to;
but on the receipt of a letter from Mr. Harrison,
Lord Spencer’s private secretary, I was informed
that it was to the Hind, 28, at Sheerness, and
that I was to come to London to be sworn in without
loss of time.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>HIND, 28</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>After being sworn in at the admiralty,<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a> I left
London to join the Hind, 28, Captain Richard Lee,
at Sheerness, in January 1795. The Medway and
Thames being frozen over, there was no communication
with the men of war.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a> I proceeded on my
journey by coach as far as Sittingbourne, and then
walked most of the way through deep snow to the
King’s ferry, which was also frozen over. At this
time my health was very bad, and coming from a
fine climate to one noted for gloomy skies, fog, rain,
bitter cold and everything else that was damnable,
I had nearly sunk under it, and I have to acknowledge
how much I was obliged to Mr. Poulden, an
officer in the navy, and brother to Captain Poulden,<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
R.N., for his kind attention. He was a fellow
traveller going also to join his ship at Sheerness.
The snow was several feet deep, and the cold
dreadful, and it was with the greatest difficulty and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>fatigue that we reached the public-house near the
ferry without being frost-bitten.</p>

<p class='c008'>You who are not too young (for it’s difficult
now to find an old person), must remember the
cruel winter the latter end of 1794 and beginning of
1795.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a> To my surprise I met at the public-house
an old messmate of mine (a Mr. Simmonds) formerly
of the Panther, and going also to join his ship. We
were half-starved and waited a considerable time
for our host to bring in the dinner, which he did at
last. To our horror and amazement, it consisted of a
leg of pork of enormous size, without a bit of lean,
and coarse white cabbage boiled with it, and as greasy
as the devil. I shall never forget the consternation
we were in; nothing else could be had, and what
made it more vexatious was the praises the great
fat fool of a John Bull landlord was passing on it.
We were obliged to swallow this greasy morsel
from downright hunger, and from its rancid taste in
danger of cholera morbus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The passage being frozen, we had no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>resource than to cross the ice on foot, which we did
at great hazard, it cracking and bending all the way.
I had a small portmanteau, for which I paid a
soldier to carry, as he was going the same way; but
when we had crossed, his heart failed him and he
refused to follow (for we passed over one by one),
and it was a long time before we could prevail on
him to make the attempt; but by promising him a
shilling or two more he took courage until he got
half way over, when he imagined the ice was giving
way, and there he stood panic-struck. We really
felt for the poor fellow, but at last he made a desperate
effort and got safe over though dreadfully
frightened. After a dismal walk we got to Sheerness,
emphatically styled by the late Captain
Gunter, R.N., ‘the —— hole of the world.’</p>

<p class='c008'>I found Captain Lee in lodgings; he seemed
much surprised at seeing me as he had no communication
with the admiralty for a long time. He
seemed astonished at my walking across the ferry,
which he considered a very hazardous undertaking.
After waiting a few days we forced a passage
through the ice and got on board and soon after,
followed his worship, old Stamp, the Mayor of
Queenborough, as pilot, and well known as a most
respectable boroughmonger of large property and
powerful interest, and would be a pilot merely
because he liked it. We soon got under way, and
in a few hours anchored in the Downs, where we
found the Leopard, 50 (the flagship), and several
men of war. We remained but a short time and
then proceeded to Spithead with a convoy.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were on this service up and down Channel,
and to Ireland, for several months without anything
material happening, until being off Waterford, after
seeing the convoy safe, we saw a suspicious lugger,
which we gave chase to and, after a run of forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>leagues, had the good fortune to capture—the Speedwell,
smuggling lugger, pierced for eighteen guns
which she had thrown overboard, as we counted
the carriages that were disposed of soon after the
guns. Her cargo consisted of spirits, tobacco, tea,
nankins, etc., with thirty-nine gigantic smugglers;
one we supposed was killed, as her muster roll had
forty. We pressed the crew and took the vessel to
Belfast, where her cargo was sold. Captain Lee,
who was a good calculator, offered the first lieutenant,
Hickey, and myself £58 15<em>s.</em> apiece for our
prize money, which after some consideration we
accepted; but when the prize money was paid, the
share of a lieutenant was only £50, so that he lost
by the spec. £17 10<em>s.</em>, besides losing with the
marine officer. We kept the crew as part of our
ship’s company, but they contrived to desert at different
times with the exception of four.</p>

<p class='c008'>I well remember while lying in Dublin Bay,
and being at breakfast with Captain Lee, in course
of conversation he observed that the four remaining
smugglers were the best men in the ship and
that he was very proud of them. He had hardly
made the observation when the officer of the watch
reported that the jolly boat was missing; the hands
were immediately turned up to muster, when it was
found that the four worthies had set off in the boat,
when or where nobody could tell. The captain
looked at us, and we at him, but no one could keep
countenance. It could not be proved in whose
watch the boat was taken. We found her at Dunleary,
but never heard of the deserters.</p>

<p class='c008'>While at Carrickfergus the assizes were held
and we had an invitation to dine with the grand jury.
We passed a very pleasant day; upwards of two
hundred were present, and several excellent songs
were sung by one of the counsellors, who was considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>equal to Braham or Incledon.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Having proceeded
to Plymouth with a convoy we remained
some time in the Sound, when the Medusa, 50,
Captain James Norman, arrived with the West
India convoy, part of which had been captured by
the enemy’s cruisers, and we were put under his
orders to proceed with the convoy to the Downs.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is well remembered by those who are not too
young that the latter end of 1795 was a very tempestuous
season, and it was a long time before an
opportunity offered to sail; we once made the
attempt and had nearly got on shore near the
Mewstone. In working out, our main topsail yard
was carried away in a squall, and we were obliged to
anchor; but the gale increasing, the cable was cut,
and we again anchored in the Sound. On November
3, the wind being favourable, the commodore
made the signal to get under way, and we were
ordered to lead up Channel. On the night of the
5th (it being light winds the whole of the time from
our leaving the Sound), between Beachy Head and
Dungeness it came on to blow a complete hurricane,
with heavy rain at south; and on the morning of
the 6th, it blew, if possible, harder, and our situation
on a lee shore dreadfully alarming, in Rye Bay,
with only storm staysails, which at last blew out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the bolt rope; the main topsail also split to pieces
from the fourth reef, leaving not a wreck behind,
and we expected the ship would upset under bare
poles.</p>

<p class='c008'>As second lieutenant, I was stationed on the
forecastle, and seeing a light right ahead I pointed
it out to Tim Coghlan, our master, who swore it
was Dungeness light and that we were all lost;
at the same time asking me for the key of the
case, as he was going to step down for a lunch,
being infernally hungry and thirsty. I asked Captain
Lee, who was on deck all night—for he was an
officer that never flinched, and where there was
danger he was always to be seen cool and intrepid—to
take some refreshment. ‘Why,’ says he, ‘I
don’t know what to say about the eating part of the
business, but I think we shall get plenty to drink,
and that presently.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Had the gale continued at south, nothing could
have saved us. With a tremendous sea, and
breakers at no great distance, there was no chance
of reaching the Downs as we could not get round
Dungeness; when in a dreadful squall of thunder,
lightning, hail and rain, the wind shifted to north or
NNW, which is off the land, and blew with the
utmost violence. But towards daylight it got more
moderate and we stood for the Downs, where we
anchored with part of the convoy in a shattered
condition, the remainder coming in soon after.
Two of them were lost on the French coast when
the wind shifted to the northward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Lee soon after left the ship, with the
good wishes of every officer and man on board.
He was a brave, generous, and meritorious officer,
an excellent sailor and skilful pilot for the British,
as well as Irish Channels, and well deserving of the
honours he now enjoys. He was succeeded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Captain John Bazely, who was one of the best
officers in the navy for skill, activity, and high
sense of honour, well read, and possessing an excellent
understanding, and his death will long be
lamented as a loss to the service and to society.</p>

<p class='c008'>November 19th, another tremendous gale came
on at SSW, which lasted the whole of the day and
most of the night. This was the gale that Admiral
Christian’s<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a> fleet suffered so much in. We expected
every minute to part, and about the last
quarter flood we began to drive; but before we
could let go our sheet anchor she brought up. The
Glebb, 74, the flagship of the Russian admiral
(Henikoff) lying abreast of us, parted and brought
up with her last anchor within half a mile of the
Break. The Montagu, 74, under jury masts, from
the westward, anchored in our wake,<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and run her
cable out to the clinch before she brought up. Had
she parted, God knows what would have become of
us, as it was the height of the gale, with thick
weather, and nothing could have prevented her
being on board of us, as all her sails were blown
from the yards. Had the gale lasted much longer
it would been of serious consequence to the ships in
the Downs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sailed with a convoy to the westward, which
service we were employed on, cruising occasionally
in the Channel and Bay, for several months. In
May 1796, coming into Plymouth Sound from a
cruise, and blowing hard, we anchored astern of the
Alfred, 74, who had driven without our being aware
of it, so that we found ourselves in an awkward
berth without room to moor. We then attempted
to get under way, but the gale increasing from the
SW, we were unable to weather Mount Batten and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>came to again. We soon after parted, and let go
another anchor and brought up between two rocks
in a perilous situation, with two anchors ahead; but
fortunately it got more moderate, and, observing
there was an undertow, so that when she pitched
there appeared no strain upon the cables, we
thought there was no occasion to cut away our
masts; and our opinion was right, notwithstanding
the wish of the knowing ones who came down by
hundreds and chalked in large letters on the rocks—‘Cut
away your masts.’ This was dictating with a
vengeance by a set of vagabond landsmen, fellows
that could rob a house easier than knot a rope yarn,
and be damned to them. A lighter with an anchor
and cable came out soon after; and the wind shifting,
we got under way and anchored in a safe berth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sailed to the westward and cruised in the Bay,
and on our return to the Sound received orders to
proceed to Spithead and fit for foreign service, and
about the latter end of August sailed with a small
convoy for Quebec. Nothing particular happened
until we got on the Banks of Newfoundland, when
we fell in with a French squadron under Admiral
Richery. It was in the forenoon watch, blowing
very hard, the wind WNW with a heavy sea, under
a close-reefed main topsail and foresail, when we
observed a ship of the line to windward with her
head to the SW, under the same sail. Made the
private signal, which was not answered. Most of
our convoy had parted company in the gale. Bore
up and made sail. The enemy also bore up and
made all sail in chase until sunset, when he gave
over chase and hauled his wind to the northward.
We hauled our wind also, and stood to the southward.
Separated from the remainder of the convoy during
the night, it blowing strong with thick weather.
There was great exultation at our outsailing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>enemy, and some on board were wishing to have
another trial, and their wishes were not disappointed;
for in three days after, about six in the
morning, two line-of-battle ships were observed
astern about two leagues off.</p>

<p class='c008'>The private signal was made, but not answered.
We were under close-reefed topsails and foresail,
steering WSW, the wind NW. The enemy made
sail and stood after us. We immediately let two
reefs out of the topsails, set topgallant sails and
hauled the main tack on board, with jib a third in<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
and spanker. It was neck or nothing, and those
who wished for another chase looked rather glum
and had not quite so good an opinion of our sailing
on a wind as they had when before it. For my
part I expected we should upset, and it was with
uncommon alacrity in making and shortening sail
between the squalls that we escaped upsetting or
being taken. The enemy knew well what he was
about, for he kept rather on our lee quarter with his
fore topmast studding sail boom run out, and the
sail ready for setting in case we had kept away. At
one time his weather main topsail sheet gave way
and he was only ten minutes in setting the sail
again; his jib also split, which he unbent and had
another set in twenty minutes, which did him great
credit. Luckily for us the sea was nearly abeam;
had we been on the other tack we must have been
taken, as we should then have bowed<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a> the sea. I
remember heaving the log and she was going ten
knots. But notwithstanding our good sailing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>enemy gained on us fast, and we should have been
captured for a certainty if the Frenchman had
possessed more patience.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Festina lente, not too fast;</div>
      <div class='line'>For haste, the proverb says, makes waste.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And so it happened; for a little before six, when
he was within gunshot, the greedy fellow let another
reef out of his topsails, and just as he had them
hoisted, away went his fore yard, jib-boom, fore
topmast and main topgallant mast. The other line-of-battle
ship was hull down astern. The chase
lasted twelve hours, during which time we ran near
forty leagues. Shortened sail and wore ship, and
as we passed to windward, we counted fifteen ports
of a side on his lower deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing further happened, except losing a poor
fellow overboard in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, until
we got to Quebec. The convoy also escaped and
came in soon after; one of them was chased, but
by fixing a pole on a tub with a lantern on the top,
and steering another course in the night, escaped.
We remained at Quebec until the latter end of
November, and then sailed with a couple of fur ships
for England under convoy. We left Quebec in the
evening. I had the first watch, and I never shall
forget the cold as long as I live.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing remarkable happened until we got to
the southward of Cape Clear, which bore north
according to our dead reckoning, and if I remember
correctly on the 23rd of December 1796, about eight
in the evening we saw a squadron of men of war, one
of them with a top light, standing to the northward,
the wind about west, and at no great distance. We
immediately hauled off to the southward, put out all
our lights and hailed the two vessels under our
charge to do the same. After standing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>southward some time, we altered our course and saw
no more of them. The wind soon after shifted to the
eastward and blew a heavy gale. Lost sight of our
convoy and after buffeting about for some days we
were obliged, for want of fuel, to put into Cork,
where we found several men of war preparing to
sail in consequence of the French being off Bantry
Bay. All the carriages and horses that could be
found were put in requisition to take the troops to
that quarter, and when we had completed our stores
and water we sailed with a squadron of frigates
under Captain Jon. Faulknor to the southward in
quest of the enemy, but they had left Bantry, where
Lord Bridport was off with the grand fleet, who
we joined with our squadron. I believe this was
the time that General Grouchy with eight thousand
men (before the arrival of our fleet) anchored in the
bay; but from fear, or some other cause, thought it
safer to set off than to land; and at Bantry, as well
as at Waterloo, shewed great want of judgment.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>We were attached to the grand fleet as a repeating
frigate; and in January 1797, we chased
by signal and captured the French privateer La
Favorite, of eight guns and sixty men, out but a
short time from Brest and had taken nothing.
After removing the chief part of the prisoners, I
was put on board as prize master with two midshipmen
and twelve men, with orders to stay by the
fleet; but on examining her defects I found her in
a very bad condition, upon which I separated from
the fleet in the evening and stood for the Channel
(being then in the Bay). We had nearly been run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>down by a three-decker—I believe the Prince
George, commanded by the late Sir Joseph Yorke—in
the rear of the fleet, and the night being as
black as Erebus we had a narrow escape. Portsmouth
being the place of rendezvous, we stood up
Channel with the wind at SW the day after leaving
the fleet, blowing a gale, under a close-reefed main
topsail and foresail.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had not an observation for several days
before we parted from the grand fleet, and in running
up Channel we got into Portland Race. I have
been in many noted places, but this infernal race
was worse than all, and I expected every moment
we should founder. The privateer being deep-waisted,
I ordered her ports to be knocked out so
as to let the sea have a clear passage through; our
hatches were battened down, but we were in danger
of being washed overboard. The sea appeared like
a pot boiling, and the spray beat over our topsail
yards. Hauled off to the southward, and fortunately
got safe out of one of the most damnable
places I ever was in. The Frenchmen were in the
utmost terror and cursed the hour they ever left
Brest. By our account we were half way between
the Start and Portland, which was very fair considering
everything. During the night it fell calm
and towards morning the wind freshened at SE
with thick weather; at daylight, stood in and
sounded fifteen fathoms near St. Alban’s Head,
and, it clearing away, bore up and made sail for
Plymouth. When near the Start we hoisted the
union jack over the French at the gaff end; but
the jack blowing away, and the halliards getting
foul, we could not for some time haul down the
French colours, which frightened a brig that was
near, and a frigate coming from Torbay under jury
masts fired (I believe) at us but at too great a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>distance to take effect. However, we got our colours
to rights and I hailed the brig, who seemed very
much alarmed until I informed him we came from
the grand fleet, a prize to the Hind. In the
evening we anchored in Cawsand Bay, and next
morning I waited on Sir Richard King, the port
admiral, who behaved in the kindest manner, and
on my explaining my reasons for leaving the fleet
he said I did what was very proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>As no despatches had arrived, I was ordered by
Sir Richard to write an account of what happened
in the fleet from the day we joined Lord Bridport
until I left with the prize, and also to give an
account of our proceedings from the time we fell in
with Richery’s squadron until our arrival at Cork.
I was put into a room and desired to take my seat
at a table with a quire of foolscap placed before me;
and like a fool I looked, for it was a long time
before I knew what to write, or how to begin. At
last I took courage, and filled three or four sheets;
bad grammar, no doubt. Sir Richard read the
whole and said it would do very well—many thanks
to him. He laughed heartily when I told him I
got into Portland Race and what a panic the
prisoners were in.</p>

<p class='c008'>I had sent a pilot off to take the brig into
Hamoaze and walked down with Sir Richard to
Mutton Cove, as he wished to see her as she
passed. He told me he was once put prize master
when a lieutenant, on board of such another and
had left the fleet as I had done and for the same
reason. This made me easy and quieted my fears.
Captain Bazely’s father was port admiral in the
Downs, and I wrote to him stating our arrival and
received an answer thanking me for the information
respecting his son. We had not been long at Plymouth
before the Hind left the fleet and put into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Portsmouth, and not finding me there supposed we
were lost, until Captain Bazely received a letter
from his father saying he had heard from me, and
that we were all well and safe at Plymouth, and in
a few days I received the following letter from
Captain Bazely:</p>

<div class='c035'>Hind, Portsmouth, February 1797.</div>

<p class='c025'>‘Gardner, my good fellow, I am truly happy
to find you are in the land of the living, and that it
was through necessity you put into Plymouth. We
are ordered to Sheerness to dock, where I shall be
devilish glad to see you; so get on board some
vessel bound to the Downs with your party, and be
sure to call on my father, who will be very glad to
see you and will send some craft to take you to the
Nore. We are all well.—Believe me to remain,
with best wishes,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yours most faithfully,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>‘<span class='sc'>John Bazely, Junr.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After clearing the prize and delivering her up to
Mr. Hemmings, the master attendant at Plymouth
and agent for Lord Bridport (who I have every
reason to thank for his great civility while I remained
in Hamoaze, in the many invitations I had
to dine at his house, where he made a point to introduce
me to the captains who visited there) I was
put on board the Medusa, 50, commanded by my
old messmate Jack Eaton, who was to take us as
far as Portsmouth. On our arrival at Spithead we
were put on board the Weasel, commanded by
Captain Lewis, and sailed for the Nore, where we
soon arrived and joined our ship at Sheerness, and
I was well received by the captain and my messmates.
Went into dock and when refitted proceeded
to Portsmouth, where we remained but a short time
and sailed with a convoy for Oporto. We had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>very pleasant passage and took out Captain A. Ball
on his way to join his ship, who left us off Oporto.
On our return we recaptured a brig in the Bay of
Biscay, and I was put on board as prize master;
but from ill health I went back to my ship and the
first lieutenant took charge of the prize in my room.</p>

<p class='c008'>On our arrival at Spithead, the latter end of
April 1797, we found the fleet in a high state of
mutiny. We had orders to fit for foreign service,
and I had directions to go with a party of seamen
and marines to the dockyard for new cables and
stores. The mutiny, which in some measure had
been suppressed, broke out afresh on board the
London, 98, Vice-Admiral Colpoys, and some of
the mutineers were killed; but the officers were
overpowered and the admiral’s flag struck by the
scoundrels, and the bloody flag of defiance hoisted
in its room. I went with my party to the yard in
the morning and began to get off the stores, when
a marine said he would not assist in rousing the
cable into the lighter and advised the others to
knock off; upon which I told him if he did not
immediately take hold of the cable with the rest I
would cut him down (which was my intention).
This had the effect and he went to work with the
others. When I got on board our men were in a
state of mutiny, and every ship at Spithead and St.
Helen’s the same. I had the first watch that night,
and the master relieved me at twelve, and everything
seemed quiet; but about three bells in the
morning watch I was sent for by the captain, and
on my coming on deck I found the ship’s company
assembled there and the captain, in the most impressive
manner, requesting them to return to their
duty, but all to no purpose. Had we been the only
ship, we should soon have driven the scoundrels to
the devil; but as we were situated, surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>line-of-battle ships acting in the same disgraceful
manner, it would have been of little use to resist.
About six a paper was handed up to the captain
with the following order in writing:—</p>

<p class='c008'>‘It is the unanimous opinion of the ship’s company
that Captain Bazely, Lieutenants Hickey and
Gardner, Mr. White, the purser, and Messrs.
Kinneer and Allen, midshipmen, are to quit the
ship by 6, or violent measures will be taken to enforce
the order.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after 6 the barge was manned and armed;
every vagabond had a cutlass, and our trunks were
handed in, with orders from the delegates not to
carry them anywhere for us. I had a brace of
pistols with a double charge which I put in my
great-coat pockets in case I should want their assistance.
It was blowing a gale of wind at NE when
we left the ship, and near ten o’clock before we
landed on Point beach; our things were handed out,
and I desired the bowman and one or two more,
who I knew to be great scoundrels, to take them to
Turner’s (living on the beach, and only a step from
the boat) shewing them at the same time my pistols
and saying, ‘You understand me.’ They then most
reluctantly took our things to the place I directed.
This was all I wanted, as I heard some of the ringleaders
say as we were quitting the ship ‘that if any
of the boat’s crew assisted in taking our things to
any place after landing they should be severely
ducked on their return’; and they were as good as
their word; for those fellows got a fine ducking the
moment they got on board, the others having
reported them.</p>

<p class='c008'>We left the Hind in May 1797, but before I
close my account I must relate a few anecdotes as
they come to my recollection. I shall begin with
the surgeon, who was a very worthy fellow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>much respected, but was strange, so that we thought
him half cracked, and he had the name of Benjamin
Bullock the Madman (a character in some work that
I forget). I was one morning walking the deck
with him when the postman came on board and
presented a letter directed to ‘Robert Anderson,
Esq., or Benjamin Bullock, Esq., Surgeon of H.M.
ship Hind. With speed.’ The letter ran thus:
‘Take care when you are going on shore, and do
not on any account pass the Devil’s Point where
Bullocks are put to death daily for the use of
the fleet. So no more at present from yours to
command, <span class='sc'>J. Talgol</span>, Slaughter House, Devil’s
Point.’</p>

<p class='c008'>He accused me of writing the letter, but he was
mistaken, and from that day to this I know nothing
of the author. He was greatly enraged and vowed
vengeance against me and my friend Harley the
purser, who was the person that gave him the name
of Ben Bullock. It happened some time after that
Harley and myself were going on shore and Anderson
said he would take a passage with us. When
near the Devil’s Point, which we had to pass, I
gave orders to the boat’s crew to pull with all their
might, ‘Give way, my lads, give way until we pass
this place.’ Anderson looked at me and said,
‘What the hell are you afraid of now? You are
always croaking about some damned thing or
other.’ ‘My good fellow,’ says I, ‘it is on your
account that I am so anxious. Don’t you remember
the friendly letter you had warning you to beware
of the Devil’s Point? It is on this account that I
want to pass it in such a hurry, as you may be
taken out and cut up for fresh beef.’ And what
made things worse, on our landing the first object
that drew our attention was a large board over a
warehouse, with ‘Bullock and Anderson’ on it in gilt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>letters of immense size, to his astonishment and
vexation.</p>

<p class='c008'>At another time, when we had a large party on
board I was sitting at the bottom of the table and
Anderson at the head as caterer. I happened to be
in conversation with Harley, who in the heat of
argument was energetically moving his hand up
and down; which Anderson observed, and leaving
the head of the table with a knife in each hand, he
placed himself between me and Harley, and holding
a knife against our breasts says he: ‘That’s for thee,
and that’s for thou; I know well what you meant by
moving your hand up and down like a cleaver cutting
up bullocks for the fleet, and be damned to you
both. Now do it again if you dare.’ After some
difficulty we persuaded him to go to the head of the
table again; but those who were strangers to his
whims looked on him with an evil eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our master (Coghlan) was a very droll fellow
and fond of carrying sail in a boat. Being sent from
the Sound to the dockyard on duty, it came on to
blow a heavy gale of wind, and we struck yards and
topmasts. In the first watch about six bells I was
walking the deck with Captain Lee, who observed
how glad he was our boat was safe, as he had no
doubt Mr. Coghlan had gone on board the flagship
in the harbour. He had not long made the observation,
when I thought (it being moonlight) I saw
something in the direction of Drake’s Island and
pointed it out to Captain Lee, who said it could not
be a boat, as nobody would be mad enough to risk his
life on such a night. By this time the object drew
near, when to our astonishment we were hailed by
Coghlan to throw a rope, and in a moment he flew
alongside. We got the yard and stay tackles over
instantly, got the men in, and ran the boat up in
safety although a heavy sea was running. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Coghlan came upon deck, the captain asked if he was
not ashamed of himself in risking the lives of the
people in the wanton manner he had done. Tim with
the greatest simplicity said, ‘Sir, if you had seen
her (meaning the boat) fly from the top of one sea
to another without stopping between, you would
really have admired her. She darted through the
breakers when crossing the Bridge (a dangerous reef
of rocks between Drake’s Island and Mount Edgcumbe)
like a race horse. I never was in such a
boat in my life.’ Captain Lee, vexed as he was,
could not help smiling, at the same time telling Tim
if he did so again strange things would take place.
Coghlan’s name was John, but someone had written
to Steel saying his name was Timothy and it was
put so on the list. Coghlan on this wrote to say it
was not his name and requested Steel to alter it;
but the same wag who had written before did so
again, and when the list was printed his name stood
as John Timothy Coghlan, and remained so, and
we always called him Tim.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a> He has gone to his
long home and has left behind the character of an
honest and worthy fellow. He left the Hind to be
master of the Trent, 36, going to the West Indies.
I dined with him a short time before he sailed, and
he was pointing out the different members of the
mess, saying that none of them could live in such
a climate. Poor fellow, he little thought while
making that remark that they all returned and he
the only one that sunk the victim of all-conquering
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the time we had nearly got on shore and lost
an anchor near the Mewstone, when working out
with the convoy, I was sent the next morning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>acquaint Commissioner Fanshawe<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a> of the circumstance,
and to request he would order a lighter with
a new cable and to weigh the anchor we had lost.
I recollect he was dressed in an old blue coat with
a red handkerchief about his neck, and in a very
crabbed humour. After staring at me for some
time he roared out, ‘I shall do no such thing.
What brought you there? Go and tell your captain
if he gets into a hole he must get out of it again. I
shall give him no assistance and you may be off and
tell him so.’ I told him that we were out of the
hole and that I only delivered my orders as I was
directed. At the same time I would thank him to
write down the words he had just made use of, as
verbal messages were uncertain. ‘Be off, sir,’ says
he, ‘and if your memory is good enough to recollect
what your captain said you cannot forget what I
have stated; so no more palaver’; and grinning
at me with a horrid set of teeth, he concluded by
saying, ‘I have other things to think of than
bothering my brains about people who get into a
lubberly situation and don’t know how to get out.’
I looked at him without making any reply, when,
turning on his heel, he said, ‘Aye, you may look’;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Nor more he deigned to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>But stern as Ajax’ spectre, strode away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As I am not fond of making mischief, I thought
it best to say nothing to Captain Lee but merely
state he refused to send the lighter. This put the
captain in a terrible rage, but the lighter being sent
off the next morning, the matter ended. Commissioner
Fanshawe was one of the first seamen in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>navy, and also one of the bravest officers that ever
did honour to the service, a rigid disciplinarian, and
to sum up all, a tight hand of the watch, as the
saying is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming from the westward to the Downs and
when round the Foreland, the captain ordered the
colours to be hoisted, when up went a swaggering
French ensign and jack, which at first was not
taken notice of, but was soon observed by the captain,
who ran forward calling out to me, ‘Look at
the French jack, sir; haul it down directly.’ ‘Sir,
said I, ‘the French ensign is at the mizen peak.’
This he had not seen, and I thought he would have
gone jumping mad. However, they were hauled
down; but as if the devil would have it, instead of
our own, up went Dutch colours. Nobody could
keep their countenance, and a general laugh went
through the ship and also in the men of war lying
in the Downs who had observed the transaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>While at Carrickfergus we were on very friendly
terms with the officers of the Irish militia and dined
often at the different messes. I remember on a rejoicing
day calling with some more on the officers
of the Cavan militia. On going upstairs to their
messroom, we found several seated round the fire
with a half barrel of gunpowder busily employed
making fireworks for the evening amusement. Our
visit was not of long duration, and I can truly say
for myself that I only made one step downstairs
and was off like a shot—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When in Hamoaze our boatswain was tried by
a court martial for repeated drunkenness and dismissed
the service. At the trial the captain of the
Tremendous, 74, was unable to attend from indisposition,
and the surgeon being sent for to attend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the court and give in his report, he happened to
make some remarks that the court considered disrespectful;
upon which he was given in charge of
Lieutenant Richards, first of the Cambridge, 84, on
board of which ship the trial took place, until the
court should determine. He was not long kept in
suspense, for on the court opening he was sentenced
to three months’ imprisonment in the Marshalsea
for contempt of court,<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and sent off that day.
People should be careful.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the passage to Quebec, after parting from
our convoy, about eight in the evening, with little
wind and going two knots, and nothing in sight, a
voice was heard astern hailing, ‘On board the
Hind, ahoy!’ I must confess I was a little staggered,
and some curious remarks were made by the
seamen. One fellow said, ‘I’ll be damned if we
were off the Cape but I should think it was the Flying
Dutchman.’ ‘As to that,’ says another, ‘he
has got a roving commission and may cruise where
he likes.’ ‘Bad luck to me,’ says a marine, ‘if it’s
not a mermaid.’ ‘And to sum up,’ says old
Macarthy, the quartermaster, ‘it may be the poor
fellow that fell overboard the other day.’ However,
the voice hailed again, saying, ‘Bear a hand
and send the boat, for I’m damned if I can keep up
much longer.’ The jolly boat was immediately
lowered down from the stern and sent in the direction
of the voice; and will it be believed that the
fellows were afraid to take into the boat one of the
main topmen (who had fallen overboard out of the
main chains, being half asleep) until he had told his
name and answered several ridiculous questions?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>At the time we took the privateer, it was given
out by our lying newspapers that the French were
starving. On the contrary the French officers told
me that everything was abundant in France, and—if
I may judge from what was on board—their
account was correct; for she had barrels of meat of
every description—alamode beef, ham, fowls, and
tongues, casks filled with eggs, coffee, tea, and
sugar, all kinds of cordial, with plenty of brandy and
different wines; so that instead of starvation, there
appeared the luxury of Lucullus, when supping in
the Apollo.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a> The French officers belonged to some
of the line-of-battle ships at Brest, but had leave
from the French Government to go on board privateers
for a certain time and cruise after our merchantmen.
When we arrived at Plymouth they
requested me to state this to the proper authorities
in the hope of getting their parole. This I accordingly
did, but without success, as they were given
to understand that being taken in a privateer they
could not be considered as officers entitled to
parole.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I found them very intelligent gentlemen; one
of them spoke English remarkably well and gave a
very interesting account of the revolution and of the
leading characters then in power without any partiality.
The opinion, he said, in France was that
the nobles and the clergy were the instigators of
anarchy and confusion, and the people did not
know how to put a stop to it. I must here mention
that one of our men who I had placed as a sentry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>fell asleep at his post, which was observed by a
French officer who, to his honour, informed me of
the circumstance. I need not say how I thanked
him. When they were sent to Mill Prison I went
with them and did everything in my power in recommending
them to the officers belonging to the
prison, who promised to make them as comfortable
as they possibly could. I had but little money,
which I divided among them. We shook hands at
parting and they gave me their address, saying
how happy they should be to see me in France
when the war was over. One of those gentlemen
had been a prisoner before in England and had his
quarters at Petersfield.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>BLONDE, 32</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I was appointed first lieutenant of the Blonde, 32,
Captain Daniel Dobree, and commissioned her at
Chatham early in March 1798, and soon after got a
draft of twenty-seven hands and a midshipman from
the Standard, 64, which was all I had to fit her out
with, and of that number, only five knew how to
turn a dead-eye in. However, we contrived to get
her hold stowed, sails bent, and topgallant yards
across, before we had any addition of men or officers.
At last our complement was completed by a
draft from the Dordrecht,<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> 64, and went to Black
Stakes, where we took in our powder and proceeded
to the Downs. We had a crack ship’s company
with our last draft, and in getting topgallant
yards up the morning after we arrived, we crossed
ours, sent them down again, and then swayed away
and had them ready for crossing before the flagship
and the rest of the men of war at anchor. Vice-Admiral
Peyton<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a> was the port admiral, and had his
flag on board the Overyssel,<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a> 64, commanded by my
late worthy friend Captain John Bazely. I expected
we should have got a reprimand for being too hasty
in our movements, especially when I saw a boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>coming from the flagship; however, instead of a
rub down, it proved to be a visit from Captain
Bazely, who paid us many compliments on the good
order the ship appeared to be in. He told me
there was a vacancy on board the flagship for a
lieutenant and that he would apply for me if I
wished it, at the same time stating that he was on
bad terms with the admiral, who was at all times a
harsh and disagreeable officer, and in the event of
his getting a frigate (which he was in expectation of)
he had no doubt would prevent me (to annoy him)
leaving the flagship, and advised me to remain in the
Blonde until he had an opportunity of serving me.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having received orders, we proceeded to Spithead
and took command of a small squadron of
gun-boats and cutters to guard the Needles passage,
and anchored off Jack in the Basket, near Lymington,
which service we performed very agreeably for
several weeks. The rebellion in Ireland taking
place, we were ordered with several men of war and
transports to proceed to Weymouth and embark
troops for that country. The king, being at Weymouth
at the time, with the royal family, it was
expected he would review the squadron; but the
news from Ireland being very serious, the troops
were embarked in a hurry, and we got under way
in company with the men of war and transports for
our destination.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here mention that the commodore of the
squadron (Captain Hardy,<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a> commanding a 64) came
on board with several other captains, and after
going round the ship and mustering us at quarters,
he addressed me, saying, ‘Sir, I feel great satisfaction
in stating that the Blonde is in the best order
of any ship in the squadron and the fittest to receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>his Majesty, should he go afloat; and for the short
time your ship has been in commission she does
great honour to her captain and officers.’ This he
said before the rest of the captains, and among the
number was my old captain (Towry) formerly of
the Berwick. In fitting out the ship at Chatham, I
did everything I could to keep on good terms with
the officers of the yard by asking them down to our
mess and paying them every little attention in my
power; and by that means I had an opportunity of
getting many things done to beautify the ship.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> I
had the head painted in colours, the quarters friezed,
a famous stand made for the arms on the quarter
deck, and trophies painted on our scuttle butts, with
half circles and circles for our pistols and cutlasses,
which made the old Blonde cut a dashing appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as we were getting under way, Captain
Hardy sent me four or five buckets of paint, with
his compliments, saying I should stand in need of
it after getting rid of the soldiers, which was really
the case, as on board they were the most helpless
and dirty devils I ever beheld—except the Russians.
It was impossible to get them up from between
decks without burning green wood in the stoves,
which the devil himself could not stand, the smoke
was so intolerable.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After a quick passage we landed the troops at
Waterford, where we remained a short time and
then returned to our station, to guard the Needles
passage for a few weeks. The Europa, 50, being
sent to relieve us, got aground near Gurnet Point,
and after lying there some time was got off and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>returned to Portsmouth to refit. More troops being
ordered to Ireland, we were put under the orders of
Captain Geo. Burdon and sailed with a small
squadron consisting of the following men of war:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c008'>On the passage we had near got on the Seven
Stones. I had the morning watch, and soon after
I relieved the deck I observed breakers upon the
lee bow and beam and at no great distance; the
wind about NNW, and our heads to the westward,
blowing fresh with a chop of a sea. The Alkmaar
was ahead, on the weather bow, and the Tromp to
windward, the Weymouth astern of all. We were
under double reefed topsail and foresail and no time
to be lost; immediately set topgallant sails, jib and
spanker; hauled on board the main tack, kept her
rap full, and when she had fresh way, put the helm
down and she stayed like a top. We made the
signal for standing into danger, and when the
Alkmaar put her helm down she missed stays, and
when they got her head round her stern was close
to the breakers. The Tromp, by being to windward
and carrying a press of sail weathered the
shoals and parted company. In consequence of
foul winds we put into Scilly for a few days, and
then sailed for Dublin, where we landed the troops.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were employed upon this service from
Dublin to Cork and then to Guernsey, and up and
down Channel with convoy, until August 1799,
when we received orders to proceed to the Baltic to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>convey the Russian troops to Holland. Sailed
from Spithead, and having taken in pilots proceeded
to Elsinore and then to Reval, with some
transports. Found lying in the roads the Russian
fleet consisting of 15 sail of the line besides frigates,
etc., under Admiral Henikoff, and several British
men of war and transports. Having embarked
some thousands of the Russian guards we left
Reval for the Texel, in company with British and
Russian men of war and several transports. We
had on board a Russian captain, two subs., a
surgeon, and 296 privates, all hoffs, choffs, and
koffs. The captain’s name was Peter Glebhoff,
who never pulled his boots off the whole time he
was on board. The men were the most filthy I
ever met with. They used to scrape the tallow out
of the bottoms of the lanterns and make it up into
balls, which they would swallow and wash down
with a drink of train oil. They had bread made on
purpose, of the coarsest flour mixed with vinegar,
and their cookery it is impossible to describe; so
that the Spartan black broth must have been a
luxury (however unpalatable) to their abominable
messes. I have positively seen them pick the
vermin off one another’s jackets, which they would
eat without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c008'>On our arrival at the Texel the whole were
immediately landed, and were soon after in action,
and the most of those we had on board put <i><span lang="fr">hors de
combat</span></i> by the next day. Poor Peter Glebhoff, who
had been sharpening his spear at the grinding stone
a few days before the landing, and vowing to
sacrifice every Frenchman he met with, was one of
the first that fell. He had been in most of the
battles under Suvorof against the Turks and Poles,
and had left a wife and family at Riga to lament
his fate. He was much liked while on board of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and we all felt heartily sorry for him. I was several
times on shore and saw the numerous wagons of
wounded soldiers from the scene of action which
by no means corresponded with the accounts given
in our Gazettes.... I had two cousins, captains in
the 17th regiment of foot—one of them (Knight)
was killed just as I was going to see him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time before we left the Texel the
Blanche, 32, Captain Ayscough, got on shore on the
Haaks—a dangerous shoal near the Texel, and some
of the boats that were sent to her assistance unfortunately
upset, and several officers and seamen
perished, owing to the surf which ran very high on
and near the shoal. The Blanche got off, and
returned to the New Deep, and sunk just as she
entered, but none of her crew were lost.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> At this
time things looked rather queer, and it was found
out after hard fighting that it was not so easy to
beat the French out of Holland as at first expected;
and we were ordered to take a cargo of runaway
Dutchmen on board, with their wives and families—about
400 altogether. A short time before we
sailed we saw the Lutine, 36, Captain Launcelot
Skynner, at the back of the Haaks, and, if I am
correct, the evening she was lost<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a> and only one
saved, who died soon after.</p>

<p class='c008'>We left the Texel in November 1799, and in
standing over to our own coast had nearly struck
by the blunder of our pilots on the Gabbard.
After escaping from this first blunder we anchored
near the Shipwash, another shoal by far more
dangerous than the former. It was in the evening
that we took up our quarters in this precious
situation, intending to get under way with the
morning tide. I must here mention that we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>two pilots; one of them had been a branch pilot
for more than twenty years. I had the morning
watch, and on relieving the deck I observed to
this branch pilot that the weather had a very
suspicious appearance. The wind at this time was
favourable for getting to sea, and we could lay five
points to windward of the tail of the shoal. I
strongly urged the pilot to get under way, pointing
out the danger of our situation should the wind get
dead on the shoal, but all to no purpose. He said
there was no fear and he must remain where he was,
as he was sure the weather would be fine, and that it
was only a light haze over the moon; upon which I
went to the captain and gave my opinion. He
agreed with me, but did not like to take charge out
of the pilots’ hands, saying he was fearful, in getting
under way, that the ship might get on shore should
she cast the wrong way. Now there was no fear of
that, as a spring on the cable would have cast her
the right way, and the loss of an anchor was of little
consequence compared with the risk of losing the
ship and our lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Far be it from me to reflect upon Captain
Dobree, who was a good officer and seaman; and
taking charge from a pilot was a great responsibility;
but when a pilot is guilty of a gross error, I
should never hesitate to take charge of the ship, if
I knew I could do so with safety, which was the case
now. But it was neglected, and as I foretold, the
wind soon after backed round and blew dead upon
the shoal, so that we could not weather either end.
At this time we were at single anchor about two
or three cable’s-lengths from the breakers, blowing
strong, and the sea getting up; at half cable;
but let go another anchor and veered to a whole
cable on the former, and half cable on the latter,
bringing two anchors ahead. Sent topgallant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>masts upon deck, and struck yards and topmasts;
the wind increasing to a gale, with a hollow sea
and great strain upon the cables. There was no
alternative but to cut away the masts, which was
immediately done; but owing to an error of one of
the officers, who ordered the lanyards of the main
stay to be cut before the lanyards of one side of the
main rigging, the main mast, in consequence fell aft,
and carried away the mizen mast, which stove the
boats on the quarters and did considerably damage
to the upper works; and some of the rigging caught
fire, from the stove in the cabin having the funnel
knocked off; but this was soon got under, and with
great exertion the wreck was cleared. ‘And now,
Master Pilot,’ says I, ‘after getting us in this
damnable situation, what next is to be done?’ The
son of a bitch could make me no answer; but the
junior pilot exclaimed ‘—— seize me if we sha’n’t
be on the sands.’ I could not help saying they
deserved to be hanged as drowning was too good
for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already mentioned that we had Dutch
troops on board with their families, and of as much
use as Castlereagh would have been with the same
number of his Lancers or Prancers.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a> The few
marines we had were worth a thousand of such live
lumber. It was ludicrous to see those Dutchmen
coming upon deck with their hat boxes, boots,
trunks, flutes and music books, ready to go on shore,
when the sea was running mountains high, and a
tremendous surf of prodigious height on the sands
close under our stern, and no chance whatever, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the ship parted, of a soul being saved; which made
Captain Dobree observe to me, ‘Where ignorance
is bliss ’tis folly to be wise.’</p>

<p class='c008'>About half-past ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we parted the best
bower, and let go the sheet anchor; and at the
greatest risk—it was neck or nothing—veered on the
small bower to a whole, and half cable on the sheet,
which brought us very near the shoal but there was
no help for it. About twelve o’clock we observed
that the small bower was stranded; and at the
moment when nothing but a miracle could save us,
in a terrific squall of thunder, lightning, hail, and
rain, the wind suddenly flew round and blew with
violence off the shoal, which saved H. M. ship
Blonde from destruction. It soon after got moderate;
we had an excellent ship’s company, and in
less than three hours we had jury masts rigged and
both anchors hove up—having saved the small
bower; made sail and anchored in a safer berth to
await the tide.</p>

<p class='c008'>About eleven <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we were surprised by a boat
coming alongside with four hands, who stated they
belonged to a galliot that had struck upon the tail
of the shoal and had beat over into smoother water,
where she sunk. The crew had taken to the boat
and were six hours beating about before they got
alongside of us, and thought we were a floating
light. As soon as the morning tide would allow we
got under way and followed some merchantmen—for
I am certain the pilots did not know the way
without having a leader—and arrived at Sheerness
in the evening;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Captain Dobree soon after left the ship to
proceed with Sir Home Popham and other captains
to Russia, and I acted as captain for several weeks
until another was appointed. Having business on
shore, I wrote to the admiralty requesting to be
superseded, which after a little delay was granted,
and Lieutenant Edwin James was appointed in my
room. I left the old Blonde and my worthy messmates
early in 1800.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now relate a few anecdotes as they come
to my memory. When near the shoal I have just
mentioned, our surgeon’s mate and the ship’s cook
were almost frightened out of their senses. The
former, who would fight any man, or face the devil
as soon as let it alone, was not equal to this; and
when the junior pilot said, ‘—— seize me if we shan’t
be on the sands,’ he clapped his hands and ran down
to the gun room, with his hair standing on end,
crying out, ‘Lost! Lost! Lost!’—and then flew on
deck again; and when the wind shifted, he cut
several capers and said ‘I’m a man again.’ As
for the cook, he had saved a sum of money by
keeping shop on board and selling things to the
ship’s company. At the time the best bower parted,
he was on the forecastle in the greatest tribulation;
says he, ‘Betty’ (meaning his wife, who was on
board) ‘will go to a better mansion, but I’m doubtful
about myself.’ He had hardly made the observation
when the sea broke over the bows that
threatened destruction and with a faltering voice he
said, ‘Liver me! Liver me!’—meaning ‘Deliver
me,’ but could not get the word out. ‘Damn
your liver, you croaking son of a bitch,’ says the
captain of the forecastle. ‘Go into your coppers
and be damned to you, and there you’ll be safe, and
don’t come barking here like a tanner’s dog.’ I
was on the forecastle with Captain Dobree at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>time. He looked at me and for my life I could not
help laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>While at Sheerness we had two courts martial
held on board of us<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a>; one on Lieutenant Brice, on
charges brought against him by Captain Charles
Brisbane while on the South American station.
The charges being proved, he was sentenced to be
dismissed the service and rendered incapable of
serving his Majesty, his heirs or successors. This
was most unfortunate for Lieutenant Brice, as his
commission to the rank of commander only waited
the result of his trial. The next was on Captain
George Tripp, for the loss of the Nassau, 64, on
the Dutch Coast.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a> The court having heard all the
evidence came to the following conclusion:—That
H.M. ship Nassau was lost through the gross ignorance
and inattention of Captain Tripp, and that he
did not set a good example to those under his
command; and for such conduct he was sentenced
to be dismissed from the service as unfit and unworthy,
and rendered incapable of serving his
Majesty, his heirs or successors.</p>

<p class='c008'>I promised (page <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>) to speak of Pat Gibson when
I came to the Blonde. He was at this time (1799)
purser of the Pallas, 38 (formerly the Minerva),
having given up the Princess Royal as too great an
undertaking for his age, being, as he told me, eighty.
The Pallas being alongside the same hulk, we were
constant visitors. As every circumstance, however
trifling, may be interesting, I shall relate a few
anecdotes. Gibson was a tall raw-boned Irishman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>from the county of Tipperary; very powerful, with
an Herculean grasp, and woe betide those who got
into his clutches if roused to anger. He was a
very jovial companion, droll in his manner, full of
anecdote, and sung in the Irish language, of which
he was a perfect master. He used to go on shore
to bring off the drunken Irish who had stayed
above their time, and I remember his saying to me,
‘Arrah, don’t you think, my dear fellow, that it’s a
hard thing that nobody can manage those spalpeens
but an ould man like me, now eighty years of age?
Och, By the Holy Father, how I knocked their
heads together, and left the mark of my fist upon
their ugly podreen faces, bad luck to them.’</p>

<p class='c008'>He was at the taking of Quebec and was one of
those that assisted in carrying General Wolfe off
the field when mortally wounded. His account of
the battle was very interesting, and in it he fought
most manfully. It was amusing to see him sitting
in his cabin with his legs stretched outside the door
singing Irish songs. The steward once interrupted
him, for which he got a thump on the back that
sent him the length of the gunroom, Pat saying,
‘To hell wid you! take dat till the cows come
home.’ There was a countryman of his by the
name of Fegan, who, in the American war, was
sent by Sir John Fielding (the celebrated magistrate
of Bow Street) on board the Conquistador, 60, then
lying as a guard-ship at the Nore with Admiral
Roddam’s flag. This Fegan was a shrewd, keen
fellow, and made a song on being sent on board of
a man of war, and Gibson was very fond of singing
it. I only remember a few verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The beginning of the war they hobbled poor Fegan,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>When first they lugged him before Justice Fielding,<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in4'>Fegan thus to him did say:</div>
      <div class='line'>You may be damned, you old blind b——,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>I will be back again before Christmas day.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By my sowl, Mr. Fegan, you are a fine fellow,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>It’s you that have done the king much wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>Call Kit Jourdan, the master at arms, sir,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Says the first lieutenant it’s always my way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And you shall have many before the day of parting—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>I think, Mr. Fegan, you mentioned Christmas day.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Etc., etc., etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When I called on him about three months
before his death he told me he was then on his last
legs; that he had enjoyed an uninterrupted state of
health for upwards of ninety years; that he never
had the headache, rheumatism, toothache or spasms,
and that he had nothing to do with doctors’ bottles
with collars round their necks, and look, says he, if
you can find any of that craft on my chimney-piece.
Before I close I must give another song of his:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Our master, Henry Webb, was a very worthy
fellow, but had strange fancies. When we were
going from the Downs to Portsmouth, and about
three leagues to the southward of Beachy Head, he
had the first watch, and having after supper taken
his drop, he dropped asleep while sitting on the
gun-carriage and had a dream that the ship was on
shore. Up he started and ran into the captain, who
had gone to bed, and called out, ‘Get up, sir, we
are all lost.’ The captain jumped out of bed and
went upon deck in his shirt, and ordered the hands
to be turned up, and sent for me. I flew up with
only my trowsers on, found everything in confusion,
and I really thought that madness had seized the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>whole. ‘Put the ship about, sir, immediately,’ says
the captain. This I complied with, and when on
the other tack I asked him if anything was the
matter. ‘Mr. Webb, sir,’ says he, ‘must be sent
to the madhouse.’ I confess I was not well pleased,
as I had the middle watch and this happened at six
bells, so I had an hour more than I expected to
trudge the deck. I should have stated that the
wind was westerly and we were beating down
Channel with a moderate breeze. The captain was
much inclined to bring Master Webb to a court
martial, but we interceded for him and the business
was looked over, but he never heard the last of this,
and would frequently be greeted with the well-known
words, ‘Turn out, we are all lost’—a compliment
he could well dispense with.</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave us a droll account that when at Lisbon
he missed the boat that was to take the officers off
in the evening who were on shore upon leave, and
was engaging a shore boat for that purpose; but
suspecting from something the boatmen were saying
that their intention was to murder him, he took to
his heels and hid under some logs in the neighbourhood
of Bull Bay and remained there all night in
the greatest terror. When he sallied out in the
morning he was covered with filth of a yellow hue
and appeared at a distance as if he had been dipped
in Pactolus! His fright was so great that he was
not aware of the bed of roses he had reposed on for
so many hours, until he started in the morning with
blushing honours thick upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>On another occasion, coming up in a small fishing
boat from Sheerness to Chatham, he heard two
of the men whispering, which he imagined was about
himself, and when making a tack and near the mud,
out he jumped and began to crawl upon his hands
and knees as fast as he could for dry land. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>poor fishermen, not knowing what to make of such
conduct, ran the boat on the mud and two of them
went after him, but to no purpose, it being dark.
They called repeatedly, but got no answer from
Webb, who was making off in terror and dismay;
and what alarmed him more was hearing the men
say, ‘D’ye see him now? Where the hell can he
be got to? He must be hereabouts.’ At last he
got out of the mud and set off for Chatham in a
nice pickle, and told his tale; but the boat had
arrived before him and the men in great tribulation
had given their version, being fearful of prosecution,
expecting that Webb was smothered or drowned;
and glad enough they were when he arrived at
Chatham and also to join in the laugh against him.
One of the fishermen happened to know him by
sight and where he lived, and by that means it got
publicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cases like this, and where ghosts were introduced,
Webb’s courage would be put to the test;
but in every other respect he was as brave as a lion.
While at the Passage of Waterford, he had a dispute
with our second lieutenant, and a challenge
was the consequence, and they asked me leave to
go on shore. As I had the greatest friendship for
them both, I refused their request, and went below
to the gunroom. Soon after one of the midshipmen
came down and informed me they were going
out of the ship. Up I went and found them in the
jolly boat just shoved off. ‘Come back,’ says I,
‘immediately, or I’ll make the sentry fire.’ On
their return I told them if they did not make it up
instantly, I would try them by a court martial for
going out of the ship contrary to orders and taking
the boat. This had the desired effect, and I had
the pleasure of making up the dispute between two
as good fellows as ever lived.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The second lieutenant (Jack Derby) was a noisy
droll fellow, always keeping the mess in a roar of
laughter. The first day he joined the ship we had
roast beef for dinner, and when brought to table it
was little better than half done by the neglect of
our black cook. Now this cook’s name was Jack
Derby also, whom I sent for, and calling him up to
the head of the table close by Lieutenant Jack
Derby, says I, ‘I am sorry, sir, you should have
such a dinner, particularly the first day of your
coming on board; but you have to thank that black
son of a bitch, Jack Derby’—an emphasis on the
word—‘whose grog shall be stopped for such
neglect.’ ‘Don’t mention it, sir,’ says he laughing;
‘I shall make a very good dinner, and suppose my
name will be inserted on the ship’s books as Jack
Derby the Second.’</p>

<p class='c008'>While lying off Lymington our launch was sent
to Portsmouth yard for stores, and Derby was sent
in her. On her return, our purser (Huish) took a
passage. On leaving the harbour the weather was
moderate, but soon after came on to blow from the
westward. Now the purser was very fearful in a
boat, and Derby carried more sail than he ought,
on purpose to alarm him. From the harbour to
Lymington, the distance is twenty-six miles, and
the wind being dead on end they had to beat all the
way. Sometimes the boat would be gunwale under,
and Huish, terrified almost to death, would every
moment rise from his seat and fall again, exclaiming,
‘Jesus, Jenny, Jesus, Jenny’ (common words
of his when things went wrong), and cursed the
hour he was fool enough to trust himself with
Derby, and if it pleased Providence to spare him
now he would never put his foot in a boat with him
even in a calm. But his troubles were not yet over,
for in getting into the Fiddler’s Race near Gurnet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Point, on the Isle of Wight side, with the tide under
their lee, there was such a sea breaking that the
launch was nearly swamped, and Derby seriously
repented his joke; while Huish in despair repeatedly
ejaculated, ‘Orontes’ bark, Orontes’ bark
will be our fate.’ (See <cite>Aeneid</cite> [i. 117]).<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a> However,
they got safe on board and created much
amusement in the account Huish gave of Derby’s
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Being ordered to embark the 23rd regiment
foot for Guernsey, and after going through the
Needles in the evening, it came on thick weather in
the first watch; and about eleven the wind, at SE,
began to blow a hurricane, with snow so thick that
we could not see half the length of the ship. We
sent topgallant yards and topgallant masts upon
deck, and hove the ship to under storm staysails.
The topsails and courses were frozen as hard as
board, and being short of complement it took nearly
the whole of the middle watch before they could be
furled. One of our main topmen was frozen and
died soon after. The officers were also aloft, and
all hands suffered most dreadfully. I was speaking
to the man at the wheel when a sheet of ice fell out
of the mizen top and knocked both of us down. It
gave me a severe blow on the shoulder and the
other a staggering thump on the back. I was so
benumbed when I got below that I had hardly life
in me. The officers of the 23rd made me swallow
hot brandy and water, and I went to bed, where I
had not been above half an hour before all hands
were called again, and I was obliged to go on deck.
The fact was the fore topsail had got loose and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>blew to rags, and the main topsail was nearly following
its example, but stopped in time, and we
had to bend another fore topsail in this cruel
weather. Towards morning it cleared up and got
moderate. During the whole course of my life I
never suffered so much as I did on that dreadful
night. However, we got safe into Guernsey and
landed our soldiers. The officers were a glorious
set of fellows, and sorry I am that I cannot find any
of their names on the list.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last time we were at the Passage of Waterford
was passed very agreeably. I had a cousin
(the son of the late Alderman Bates of Waterford)
who had an estate in the neighbourhood. He used
to send horses and a carriage for the officers of our
mess, who were frequently at his house. He was
field officer of the district and kept a great deal of
company, and gave many parties in honour of the
old Blonde. On one occasion he came on board to
invite us to an evening party, when he and Jack
Derby got into conversation, and at last got so
drunk that it was evening before they got sober
enough to leave the ship. It was then time to go,
and off they started, Derby in full uniform. When
the boat landed, he, with all the politeness imaginable,
wanted to hand Bates out. This Bates declined.
‘Then,’ says Jack, ‘we’ll go together.’ Now the
gang board was hardly broad enough for two, and
the moment they stepped upon it over they went
where the water was four feet deep and got a fine
ducking. Derby would not return to the ship, but,
mounting a horse belonging to Bates, set off in his
wet clothes to meet the party, and there Bates
dressed him in regimentals, and a precious figure he
cut. We passed a very pleasant evening, there
being near seventy present. One of the ladies
sung the beautiful air of ‘Eileen Aroon’ in Irish—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>translation of which I met with a few years ago
and give it as follows:—</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a fidgety and crabbed commodore
(Captain Stevenson of the Europa, 50) who neither
enjoyed pleasure himself nor would let anyone else
do so: who kept Blue Peter flying the fortnight we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>remained, which said No! to every invitation to the
city.</p>

<p class='c008'>In going from Portsmouth to the Downs we
gave a passage to an assistant surgeon, red hot from
the land of cakes, who had never been on board of
a man of war, and had now an appointment to a
gun vessel. Seeing that he was a complete greenhorn,
we took him into our mess that the midshipmen
should not make a butt of him, for which he was
very thankful. On leaving the ship in the Downs,
he took the surgeon aside, saying, ‘You have all
been very kind to me, particularly the purser, and
I would wish to make him some acknowledgment.
D’ye think if I gave him three pounds of cheese!!!
it would satisfy him?’ After he landed at Deal he
put up at the Three Kings. Captain Dobree,
happening to go into the coffee room, observed him
in one of the boxes, and hearing him ask the waiter
what there was for dinner, stayed to hear the result.
The bill of fare being given him, he ordered an
apple pie, which was brought him made in a good-sized
dish. This he devoured in a short time, and
ordered the fellow to bring him another, which he
demolished also, and then rang the third time and
asked him if he had any more of those pies. On
the waiter saying they had, he said, ‘You may as well
bring me one more,’ upon which Captain Dobree
exclaimed ‘Merciful father!’ and left him in his
glory. The captain told me this the moment he
came on board, saying he never met the fellow of
him in all his peregrinations.</p>

<p class='c008'>About six months after this a small squadron of
gun vessels were ordered from the Downs to cruise
on the French coast. It happened that his appointment
was dated before the other assistant surgeons
in the above squadron, and will it be believed that
he considered himself entitled to the same rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and emoluments as physician of the fleet, and made
application for the same, and got for answer (as
we were told) that the board disapproved of the
whole of his practice.</p>

<p class='c017'>In April 1801 I was appointed to the Brunswick in
Portsmouth harbour and did duty as first lieutenant
until the senior officer made his appearance, which
was not until I had fitted the ship out. This officer
was my old shipmate, Jack Key, formerly of the
Barfleur, and one totally unfit for the situation. In
consequence, Captain George Hopewell Stephens,
who commanded the ship, was obliged to apply
to the admiralty for an officer senior to Key,
and Emanuel Hungerford was appointed first
lieutenant, Captain Stephens expressing his regret
at the circumstance, observing that it was a hard
case but that he would do everything in his power
to serve me. He was as good as his word, and I
found him through life a sincere friend. Hoisted
the flag (red at the mizen) of Rear Admiral John
Holloway, as junior port admiral, and received
orders to proceed without loss of time to Spithead;
and having struck the flag, sailed to join the North
Sea fleet under Admiral Dickson, who had his flag
(blue at the main) on board the Blenheim, 74.
After cruising several weeks and putting into
Yarmouth Roads occasionally, we were next ordered
to join the grand fleet under Admiral Cornwallis
(Billy Blue) off Brest blockading the French fleet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>until the negotiations for peace; when, in consequence
of the French sending a squadron to the
West Indies, our admiral detached from the grand
fleet five sail of the line in October 1801 for the
same destination. The squadron consisted of the
following men of war:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Came into Port Royal the Française, 36, French
frigate, to purchase different articles for Madame
Le Clerc, the wife of the commander-in-chief of the
French army at St. Domingo, and sister of Napoleon
(then first consul of France). A court martial was
held on Captain Thomas New for the loss of his
ship,<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a> on which charge he was acquitted. During
our cruise off St. Domingo we could observe the
devastation occasioned by the war with the French
and the blacks; several plantations and villages on
fire. At this time sickness began to make its
appearance in the fleet, and the Brunswick had 287
men on the sick list, and buried a great many. The
Vengeance, 44, a prize, tailed on shore and many
lost their lives in endeavouring to get her off,
particularly the party of thirty-four from the Brunswick,
the greater part of whom died; and this for
an old French frigate not worth repair, being rotten
and useless.</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time before we arrived, the Topaze, 36,
on a cruise, buried all hands except fifty-five;
the captain (Church) and all the officers died, and
the ship was brought in by the gunner. Eight sail
of the line having been surveyed and ordered home,
we were one of the lucky squadron. Each ship was
directed to take on board four tons of iron hoops
lying at a place called Greenwich; and our launch
took several trips for this precious cargo; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>thermometer generally 112,<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a> and I have to remember
many damnable roastings I got in grubbing for rusty
hoops not worth their carriage. So much for the
wisdom of Sir John. What could induce him to
think of such a thing was only known to himself.
Everyone at first thought it a hoax until they took
the trip. I have heard many men say how dearly
they liked the West Indies; the heat was so fine and
conducive to health. Much good may it do them;
and I, for one, shall never envy them taking up their
quarters with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day before we left Port Royal happened to
be sweet May Day and I shall never forget it. The
squadron ordered home had to send as many of
their stores as they could spare to the dockyard. I
had to tow our spare topmasts and several spars,
and with great fatigue got them landed and put into
store; the heat beyond description; so much so
that near thirty of the blacks belonging to the yard
were taken ill and sent to the hospital. Captain
Stephens was one of those who liked the West
Indies, and coming into the yard at this time, when
not a breath of air was stirring, I pointed out to
him some fowls that had taken their station as well
as myself under an archway, with their wings
drooping and their bills open gasping for breath.
‘Sir,’ says I, ‘the fowls wax warm although indigenous,
and don’t appear so comfortable in this
fine climate as might be expected.’ ‘Let us be off,’
says he, ‘for there’s no standing this.’</p>

<p class='c008'>As several of our men had to receive extra pay
for work they had been doing, I had to stay a
considerable time in consequence of some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Jacks-in-office waiting to get change to settle with
our men; and I had a hot dispute with one of them
(a Mr. Bull), who felt much hurt at my saying
‘What a cow you are to keep us in this infernal
oven until our faces are the colour of your own (he
was a man of colour)—bad luck to you.’</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time before we knew of our being
ordered home I went to dine on board the Elephant
with Lyford, the first lieutenant (my old messmate
in the Blonde). They expected to be sent home,
and were so sure, that Captain Peers of the
marines, and Jones, the purser, said how happy they
should be to take any letters I had to send to
England, and would be certain to call on my friends
as soon as the ship arrived. Poor fellows, little did
they think that instead of going home their bones
would be left at the Palisades. I am grieved to say
that out of the whole mess only two or three
returned. I was taken ill the day I dined with
them, and I can truly say that I feel the effects of
the wretched climate while I am stating this.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 2nd of May we left Port Royal and for
two or three days were becalmed in sight of the
accursed harbour. At last we joined Rear-Admiral
Campbell off Cape Tiburon. On our sick list being
shown to the admiral he seemed astonished at the
number, and when he found it was so swelled with
yellow fever patients he ordered our boat off immediately
and would not suffer any communication
with our ship. We remained cruising with the
squadron for a short time, and then left the fleet for
England with the following men of war:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Went through the Crooked Island passage and
parted company with the commodore, who, with
five sail of the line, stood to the eastward and left
the Powerful, Brunswick, and Edgar or Orion (I
forget which) to get home as they could, being bad
sailers. But Sir Francis Laforey, in the Powerful,
knew well what he was about and stood to the
northward. We had dreadful weather near Bermuda
for three days, but moderate after, and when
on the Banks of Newfoundland altered our course
for the Channel and got there a few hours before
the flying squadron, who we joined, and soon after
arrived at Spithead after a passage of nearly two
months, and went into harbour, where the Brunswick
was paid off in July 1802.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before closing I must relate a few occurrences,
beginning with the captain. This gentleman
was first lieutenant of the Janus, 44 (upon two
decks) commanded by Captain Glover in the
American war, and was one of the small squadron
under the late Admiral Cornwallis, who at this time
was captain of the Lion, 64, in the action with the
French under Lamotte-Picquet,<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> who had a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>superior force. As the action commenced, Captain
Glover (who had been ill some time) died, and
Lieutenant Stephens fought the ship in a manner
that will do eternal honour to his memory. He
was opposed in the line to a French 74 and fairly
beat her out of her station. When the battle was
over he went on board the commodore and reported
the death of Captain Glover, and that he
had died below, as the surgeon had reported his
being unable to be brought on deck. Now Captain
Glover had been spoken of before as not having
exerted himself so well as was expected; and Cornwallis
(who was a friend of his) observed to Lieutenant
Stephens that he ought to have let his
captain die on the quarter deck, as he well knew
what had been said of him on a former occasion;
and notwithstanding the surgeon’s report that he
could not be removed from his cot, he never forgot
it. This account I had from Captain Stephens;
and when we joined the grand fleet off Brest
under Admiral Cornwallis, we had not been
there two hours before he made to us the signal of
disapprobation for what in fact the ship ahead of us
was to blame for. Says Captain Stephens to me,
‘Gardner, did I not tell you that Billy Blue would
hold me in his kind remembrance? See how he
begins to compliment me before the whole fleet.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Stephens was a brave and meritorious
officer, an excellent sailor, and a master in naval
tactics. I found him, both on board and on shore,
a sincere friend. He applied for me to go as his
first lieutenant when he was appointed to command
the Captain, 74, but from ill health I was unable to
join. He died a rear-admiral of the white, lamented
by numerous friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall never forget the morning before we took
our departure from the grand fleet off the Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Rocks. The signal was made to put ourselves
under the orders of the Goliath, 74, with the ships
I have already mentioned, and we imagined it was
to go into port as the first division to be paid off.
I had the middle watch and had turned in, when
about five our master thundered at my door and
calling out, ‘Here’s news for you, you ragged-headed
rascal; turn out and hurrah for the back of
the Point and Capstan Square! paid off by the
hokey, in a few days.’ He then began singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jolly tars, have you heard of the news?</div>
      <div class='line in4'>There’s peace both by land and by sea;</div>
      <div class='line'>Great guns are no more to be used,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Disbanded we all are to be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh! says the admiral, The wars are all over;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Says the captain, My heart it will break;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! says the bloody first lieutenant,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>What course of life shall I take?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He then began to cut such capers that I thought
he was mad. For my own part, I was in high
spirits and got up and roused out several more who
had not heard of the good news, when unfortunately
a cutter came under our stern and sent a boat on
board. When the officer came on the quarter deck,
our master, full of glee, went up to him and said, ‘If
you have any letters, give them to us and we’ll take
them in for you.’ ‘The devil you will?’ says he.
‘That would be a pretty circumbendibus, to send
letters to Portsmouth <em>viâ</em> Jamaica. Why,’ says he,
‘you don’t laugh.’ And well he might say so, for
no lame duck on change ever cut a more rueful
appearance than the master, who damned his eyes,
and went below to make his will, wishing bad luck
to the fellow who brought the news.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had to victual and get stores from the rest
of the fleet, with a heavy swell and the ship rolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>like a tub. She was the worst sea boat that ever
was built, drawing less water by some feet than the
other ships of her rate, but of great breadth and
superior size. She had a trick of carrying away
her main topmast close by the cap, by a particular
jerk in pitching; and as we were informed by Mr.
Yelland, the carpenter (who had been appointed to
her for years before), could never be prevented;
and here she played the same game, and laboured
so dreadfully that it was with the utmost difficulty
we could get the stores on board and another main
topmast rigged, so as to be ready to join the
squadron. She rolled so that the scuttle butts
broke adrift, and a poor fellow got so much injured
by one of them that he died soon after. She also
held a bad wind, so that it was no easy task for an
officer to keep her in her station; and to sum up the
whole of her good qualities, on her last cruise she
had nearly drowned all hands, and it was by uncommon
exertion and good luck they succeeded in
getting her into port, where they made her a
powder ship, the only thing she was fit for.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Before we left the fleet, one of our lieutenants
was taken ill and sent home, and Lieutenant Hector
Maclean came in his room—he was senior to me
and appointed second. This was another hardship,
but Captain Stephens told me not to mind it as he
would do everything in his power to serve me. I
told him that Lord Hugh Seymour, the admiral
commanding on the Jamaica station, was an old
friend and shipmate of my father’s, and I would
thank him to mention me to him when the ship
arrived, which he said I might depend on. But,
unfortunately for me, Lord Hugh died before we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>got out, regretted by everyone, and was succeeded
in the command (until the arrival of Sir J. T. Duckworth)
by a man<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a> as proud as the mighty Prester
John.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had many strange beings in our wardroom—I
shall begin with the master and surgeon. Our
first lieutenant gave the former the name of Pot
Guts, and the surgeon the cognomen of Bottle
Belly. The master saved everything he could,
having a family; and for this he was considered by
some as very near. Now the surgeon was one that
loved good living, and used to eat very hearty and
seemed to devour everything with his eyes on the
table. I remember his saying to the master in a
satirical manner, ‘Mr. Wills, don’t you intend to
purchase a black servant for your good lady?’
‘Why,’ says Wills, ‘I had some idea of doing so,
but to tell you the truth I am fearful you would eat
him on the passage.’ The surgeon had nothing
further to say. While lying at Port Royal, Wills
was caterer of the mess and went to Kingston to
purchase dollar pigs; and going into a house he saw
some people lugging a man downstairs, and on his
asking what was the matter, they told him it was
only a man who had died of the yellow fever. This
gave him such a turn that to recover his spirits he
was obliged to drink seven glasses of grog before
(to use his own words) he could make his blood circulate,
and for several days he was on the look-out
for the black vomit.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the dollar pigs he brought with him was
deformed, having a head as long as his body, and
when put into the sty with the others he killed the
whole of them; and some of the seamen got it into
their heads that this pig was the devil. Now Wills
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>was a bit of a methodist and did not like this, and
one morning he had the devil knocked on the head
and hove overboard, observing it was the last time
he’d have anything to do with a shaver like that.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant used to play many tricks
with Wills. Once when the packet came in, we
were looking at her out of the wardroom windows,
when up started Hungerford, who swore that Mrs.
Wills and her two daughters were in a boat under
the stern and coming alongside, and that he saw
them leave the packet which had just arrived from
England. Out he ran from the wardroom to escort
them, and poor Wills looked stupid with surprise.
A few minutes after the door opened and in came
Hungerford with three naked black fellows, who
he introduced as Mrs. Wills and her two daughters
in the newest fashion from England. Wills, angry
as he was, could not help joining in the laugh.
When the ship was in Portsmouth harbour, I went
with Hungerford to dine with Wills, who lived at
Portsea. He had on his door a large brass plate
with ‘Methuselah Wills’ engraved thereon in capital
letters. When we returned, Hungerford swore
that old Wills had the following inscription on the
above brass plate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Methuselah Wills Esquire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Master in the Royal Navie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Passed for a first-rate ship of 110 guns,</div>
      <div class='line'>Him and his wife lives here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Poor Wills was a very good fellow; he died the
senior master on the list at the age of eighty-three,
and lies, with a great many more of my old shipmates,
in Kingston churchyard, near Portsmouth.
The last time I saw him was on the day the Princess
Charlotte, 100, was launched. We were in
the dockyard together and had just passed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>bridge when it gave way with the gates belonging
to the dock, by which accident near twenty people
were drowned, and we escaped the same fate by
about three minutes.<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I must now speak of a very different kind of
being—poor unfortunate Jack Key, our third lieutenant.
He had many vices, particularly hard
drinking, but more his own enemy than any others.
He was sent to Port Royal Hospital and invalided,
and remained there after we sailed, in great distress,
not being able for some time to get a passage home.
One gentleman with feelings that do honour to him,
took pity on the destitute. This gentleman was
Mr. Carroll, assistant surgeon belonging to the
Goliath, who, in the kindest manner, brought him
on board his ship to provide for his wants, and did
everything in his power to relieve him in his miserable
situation; but the march of intellect among
the superior officers rendered the good intentions
of Mr. Carroll of little avail, as they ordered poor
unhappy Jack out of the ship without loss of
time.<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Mr. Carroll is now a surgeon in the navy of
long standing, and in extensive practice in Walworth.
Key, from his dark complexion, had the
nickname of Cocoa Jack, and was always, when the
weather had the appearance of being bad, seen with
a piece of wool between his finger and thumb ready
to put in his ear, which made them say, ‘We are
going to have bad weather; Jack is wool gathering.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>I once relieved Jack at 12 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> When
I came on deck he was not to be found. It was
blowing fresh, we were on a wind, the weather topsail
braces gone, the yards fore and aft and the
weather backstay falls overhauled. Why the topmasts
did not go was no fault of Jack’s. At last I
found him asleep in the lee scuppers and more than
half drunk. On another occasion, when with the
grand fleet off Brest, the signal was made for the
ships to send boats to unload the victuallers, and I
was sent with the launch and an eight-oared cutter
for that purpose. As there was a great swell we
had a difficult task to clear them, and it was late in
the evening before we could take our launch in tow,
and then pulled for the ship (I think about 7 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>),
which was about a league off. Now Cocoa Jack
had the first watch, and the ship was lying-to for
the boat until the captain went to supper; when
Jack, thinking we were too far from the admiral,
made sail for some time and left us to shift for ourselves.
At this time the wind freshened and the
sea began to break, and I had serious apprehensions
for our safety, and we did not appear to near the
ship, whose distinguishing lights were scarcely
visible. At last after near five hours’ labouring at
the oar we got alongside. On going upon deck I
found Jack had gone below without being relieved,
and seated at the wardroom table with cold beef
and a bumper of grog before him. ‘Ah, Tony,’
says he, ‘you have got on board at last? I had
almost given you up.’ Although he was my senior
officer I could not help saying, ‘Damn your old
cocoa soul, did you want to drown all hands of us?
Why did you not heave to before?’ ‘Lord help
you,’ says he; ‘we have been lying-to these three
hours.’ Now what Jack called lying-to was this: he
let go the main-top-bowline, kept the sail shivering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>but not aback, and the helm a little a-weather, so
that the ship forged ahead considerably. With
all his faults he was a good-tempered fellow, and I
said no more.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our purser was a glorious fellow for keeping it
up; and after taking his full share of Madeira would
then turn to upon rum and water, and about two or
three in the morning would give his last toast, ‘A
bloody war and a sickly season!’ and then retire in a
happy state. I once told him when he had the dry
belly-ache after drinking port wine, that it was likely
he’d go to the palisades (the burying ground), but
that I would be happy to do anything for him in
England that lay in my power. He gave me a look
that expressed everything but thanks.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here relate a circumstance which took
place on the evening of the day we made Deseada.
We had a dog on board that in fact belonged to no
one, but the ship’s company were very kind to the
poor animal, who used to get well fed from the different
messes, and was quite at home fore and aft.
The evening was fine, with light winds, and the
ship going about three knots, when some wicked
fellow (supposed to be the son of a clergyman)
threw the poor dog overboard when several sharks
were round the ship. It was naturally supposed
they had made a meal of him, but that was not the
case, as they had more mercy than the ruffian who
was guilty of such cruelty. On the arrival of the
squadron at Port Royal one of our officers went on
board (I think) the Captain, 74, when to his astonishment,
who should come jumping round him but the
lost dog. On his relating the circumstance to the
officers, they told him that about ten o’clock of the
evening in question they were upwards of two miles
astern of us when they heard a strange noise under
their bows. At first they thought it was a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>overboard until they heard the dog bark, when one
of the men went down by a rope and caught hold of
the poor creature by the neck and got him safe on
board. A blanket belonging to a sailor was towing
overboard which he got hold of with his paws and
held on and by that means was rescued from a
watery grave. His new shipmates wished to keep
him and with them he remained. Of the young
man who threw him overboard, if I were to pronounce
an eulogy on his character I should without
flattery say:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On Newgate steps Jack Chance was found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bred up in St. Giles’s pound;</div>
      <div class='line'>He learned to curse, to swear, to fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did everything but read and write;</div>
      <div class='line'>And bawdy songs all day would sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they all declared he was just the thing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Our first lieutenant (Hungerford) was a very
droll fellow but fractious from disappointment. He
was in the Trusty, 50, when the late Admiral
Walker commanded her at the time she put into
Cadiz, where some of her officers were arrested and
sent to prison by the Spanish Government for
smuggling off money; for which Captain Walker
was tried by a court martial and dismissed the service.
He and Hungerford were upon very bad
terms, and happening to meet in High Street,
Portsmouth, Hungerford with a cane began to
strike at him, when Captain Walker in his defence,
caught hold of a hod belonging to a mason who
was standing by, and made a blow at Hungerford,
which, fortunately for him, missed the mark, and
several officers coming up, a stop was put to any
further proceedings. This business hurt Hungerford
in the service and made him many enemies.
Captain Walker was reinstated and died a rear-admiral.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>He commanded the Monmouth, 64, in
the Dutch action under Duncan and behaved with
uncommon bravery. Hungerford was a very good
officer and seaman and an indefatigable first lieutenant.
In watching, quartering, stationing, and
regulating the ship’s company in every respect he
showed great ability. He was a great mimic, and
very droll in other respects. I remember at Port
Royal, when he was ill, his pretending to be dumb
and mad, and carrying on the joke for a whole day
on purpose to annoy the surgeon. He put on a
white great coat belonging to Captain Rea of the
marines, with his sash and sword, and a large
cocked hat and feather, strutting about the wardroom
and making a dead set at Fuller whenever he
came in. However, about seven in the evening he
found his tongue and said to me, ‘What a damned
fool I made of Bottle Belly; how easily I humbugged
him.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The day we made the east end of Jamaica
I had the forenoon watch, and was walking the
deck with Captain Stephens, when Lieutenant
Morgan of the marines called out from the gangway
to the gunner’s mate to get a gun ready and fire
into the ship abreast of us. On my asking him
what he meant by such extraordinary conduct, ‘Sir,’
says he, ‘I am not accountable to you for my
actions’; and going up to the captain he told him
he was no longer captain of the Brunswick, but that
he would take pity on him and suffer him to keep
possession of his cabin for the present. The captain
looked at me in amazement. ‘Sir,’ says I, ‘Mr.
Morgan is certainly deranged.’ He was then sent
below, and on going down the quarter deck ladder,
he roared out to the man at the wheel, ‘Put the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>helm a starboard, you damned rascal.’ The captain
dined with us that day, and, after the cloth was removed,
Morgan came to the table, and on something
being said to him he took up a glass of wine, part
of which he hove in the captain’s face, and the glass
at Jack Key’s head; and when we seized hold of
him, he called me a damned conceited whelp, and
that he always saw a little greatness about me that
he never could put up with. This young man’s
brain was turned by diving into things he did not
understand, and it may be said in truth of him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A little learning is a dangerous thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He was invalided and sent home, and got the retirement,
but never recovered his reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another of our marine officers (Augustus John
Field) was a very strange being. He was on board
the Quebec, 32, in the action with the Surveillante,
French frigate, in the American war. Both ships
were dismasted after very hard fighting, when the
Quebec unfortunately caught fire. Her brave captain
(Farmer) would not quit, and was blown up in
his ship. Out of the number saved Lieutenant
Field was one and got a considerable lift in his
corps for his bravery. He was a very good fellow
in many respects, but drew a long bow and kept it
up too much. He had been through all the
changing scenes of life, and told incredible stories—that
he was descended from the Plantagenet family
and could trace his genealogy to Henry the Second.
By way of amusement I have seen him rest the calf
of one leg on the knee of the other and then drive
several pins up to the head in the calf of his leg,
saying he would leave them to the mess as a
leg-a-cy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our ship was full of rats, and one morning he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>caught four which he had baked in a pie with some
pork chops. When it came to table he began
greedily to eat, saying, ‘What a treat! I shall dine
like an alderman.’ One of our lieutenants (Geo.
M. Bligh) got up from the table and threw his
dinner up, which made Field say, ‘I shall not
offend such delicate stomachs and shall finish my
repast in my cabin,’ which he did and we wished
the devil would choke him. When he had finished,
he said one of the rats was not exactly to his taste
as the flesh was black; but whether from a bruise
or from disease, he could not say, but should be
more particular in future in the post mortem examination.
I never was more sick in my life, and am
so to this day when I think of it. Our captain of
marines (Rea) was a very worthy fellow. He had
great antipathy to the West Indies, and was always
cursing Venables and Penn for taking possession of
Jamaica, and was sorry Oliver Cromwell did not
make them a head shorter for their pains. I have
often heard him repeat the following lines as a
morning and evening hymn</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Venables and Penn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two bloody-minded men,</div>
      <div class='line'>In an evil hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Those seas did explore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blundering about</div>
      <div class='line'>This cursed hole found out;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for so doing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The devil has them stewing;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with him they may remain</div>
      <div class='line'>Till we come this way again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which we think howsomdever</div>
      <div class='line'>(As our boatswain says) will be never;</div>
      <div class='line'>And let all the mess say Amen!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When cruising off Cape Tiburon I was sent in
our cutter to board a Yankee about two leagues
off and to purchase stock. Our surgeon by way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>pastime took the trip with me. As the Yankee had
plenty for sale, and it being a dead calm, I loaded
our boat with live and dead stock until she was
pretty deep in the water. On our return, the sharks
began to muster and the live stock to ride rusty.
The surgeon said it was a damned shame to trifle
with people’s lives in that manner by overloading
the boat, and cursed the hour he ever came with
me; and it by no means eased his fears when one
of the boat’s crew said, ‘Please, your honour, if we
don’t cut the b——s’ throats’ (meaning the live
stock) ‘their hoofs will be through the boat’s bottom,
as they are kicking like blazes, and here’s a bloody
shark close alongside us.’ However, we got safe
alongside after a long tug. The surgeon with a
woeful countenance told a lamentable tale, which
made Captain Stephens and the rest laugh heartily.
He took good care never to volunteer his services
with me in a boat again. He has often put me in
mind of the trip and I hope he will live long to
do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a tedious passage home, and when off
Bermuda it was a gale of wind and a calm alternately
for three days and nights, with thunder and
lightning. On one of the nights I had the middle
watch and was obliged to clue down the topsails
upon the cap eight or nine times, blowing a gale of
wind one moment and a calm the next. The night
was as dark as Erebus between the flashes, and
then as light as broad day. Through one flash I
saw our surgeon coming on deck rolled up in a
white great coat, and I said to Captain Stephens
(who was up most of the night and standing with
me on the gangway):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By the pricking of my thumbs</div>
      <div class='line'>Something wicked this way comes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Captain Stephens would always repeat the above
when he saw Fuller come on deck. I have often
wondered that no accident happened to the ship
from the lightning, which was beyond everything of
the kind I ever saw. This was the only bad
weather we had during the voyage, which was a
lucky circumstance for the Brunswick; for had a
gale of wind come on for any length of time we
certainly should have foundered.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now let me say in the language of the

  <h2 class='c006'>AGENT OF TRANSPORTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I was employed on this service but a short time
in Portsmouth Harbour and had several transports
to superintend, and was in expectation of sailing to
the Mediterranean; but as ill luck would have it,
our destination was altered to that infernal bake-house,
Port Royal, Jamaica. I then thought it
time to be off and I wrote to the board to be superseded,
which gave great offence to Sir Rupert
George<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a> (the chairman). However, my request was
granted and I left a service that I never would
accept of, had I my time to go over again, upon
any consideration. For the short time I was in it
I saw enough to convince me that if an officer did
his duty, he would be like the hare with many
friends; and if he acted otherwise, he must lay himself
open to any puny whipster who might wish to take
advantage of his good nature. I was succeeded by
Lieutenant Jump, who refused to take charge of the
stores, saying he had enough hanging over his head
already (being, as I understood him, in the transport
service before). However, I settled everything to
my satisfaction, returning into store all the articles
I had drawn; struck my swaggering blue pennant<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a>
and resigned my command to the above officer,
wishing him joy and not envying him his appointment.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In such a season as the above I arrived at Hastings
on the 30th of January 1806. I was appointed to
the station by Lord Garlies, one of the lords of
the admiralty, who behaved to me in the kindest
manner. After waiting on Captain Isaac Schomberg,
who superintended the Sea Fencibles from
Beachy Head to Dungeness, I proceeded to join
my station about three miles to the eastward of
Hastings. When I got to the summit of Fairlight
Down, about 600 feet above the level of the sea,
the first object that struck me was a hut, built of
turf, in a ruinous state, and on the top a figure with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>a soldier’s jacket on. ‘Hallo!’ says I; ‘Is this the
signal station?’ ‘Yes, zur,’ says he. Why then,
thinks I, I’m damned if I don’t give up the appointment.
‘Where’s the midshipman?’ says I.
‘Midshipman, zur? why, there be only me and
another soger, and I expects to be relieved to-day.’
‘By whom?’ says I. ‘Vy,’ says he, ‘by two
melishy men, and I thought you and that ere lad’
(meaning my son, who was with me, and under six
years of age) ‘was them till you comed near.’ I
could not help smiling at this, and taking a turn
round the premises I thought I would look at the
interior. I did so, but backed out again in a hurry,
from filth and wretchedness. [The detailed description
of these is omitted.]</p>

<p class='c008'>On coming out I happened to cast my eye to
the SE, and there I saw another signal station;
and on making enquiry, I was informed by a
labourer that the station I had just observed was
the right one, and that this was only for the fogeys
to look out from; so away I trudged over several
ploughed fields and at last arrived at my destination,
in the room of Lieutenant Francis Gibbon, deceased,
who had formerly been a messmate of mine in the
Salisbury.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer to recollect
everything that happened for the eight years
and ten months that I remained in this place, and I
shall merely relate a few occurrences as they come
to my recollection. I had a midshipman, two signalmen,
and two dragoons, under my superintendence;
and when anything particular took place one of the
dragoons was sent off with the despatch to the
nearest commanding officer. We had the strictest
orders to be on the look-out by night and by day,
in consequence of the threatened invasion, and our
being so near the French coast that on a clear day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the camp at Boulogne could be seen without a glass,<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a>
so that the utmost vigilance on our part was required.
Blue lights, fire beacons, etc., were in constant
readiness, and the French flotilla at Boulogne,
Calais, Ambleteuse, and Vimereux were hourly expected
to make a start.</p>

<p class='c008'>Independent of this, whenever the wind blew
strong from the westward, so as to occasion the
cruisers to take shelter under Dungeness, the
French privateers were sure to come over and pick
up the struggling merchantmen before the men of
war could regain their station off Beachy Head.
We had also to be constantly on the watch to give
notice in case of smugglers being on the coast, and
to prevent prisoners of war making their escape
from the vicinity of our station, a signal for that
purpose being made from one post to another; so
that we had no relaxation from duty except in a
thick fog, which sometimes would take place for
nine or ten days together, during which time we
had only to walk round the cliffs and along the seashore.
I have heard many say that a signal station
was an easy berth, and only fit for old and worn-out
officers. This I flatly deny; and, without fear of
contradiction, can safely say that I suffered more
from anxiety at this station than ever I did on
board of a man of war. In the latter, when one’s
watch was over, a little rest could be obtained; but
at the station the night was worse than the day, as
the flotilla were expected to take advantage of the
darkness so as to be over in the morning, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>night signal was more anxiously watched than that
of the day. When Earl St. Vincent was first lord
of the admiralty, Lieutenant John Henry St. John
Page (an old schoolfellow of mine, who I had the
following account from) applied to him for a signal
station, stating that he was unfit for active service
in consequence of a paralytic stroke which affected
his arm and one of his eyes. His lordship wrote
for answer, ‘That an officer of a signal station
ought to have two eyes, and damned good eyes
they ought to be.’ However, he complied with his
wishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>From our elevated situation I have often been
in dread for the safety of the house, particularly in
the SW gales, and have frequently expected that
the board would be obliged</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To set a figure, to discover</div>
      <div class='line'>If we had fled to Rye or Dover;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and I’m astonished that the house did not blow
away. I well remember one dreadful gale blowing
down our chimney, which lay upon the roof without
breaking through, forming an angle of 45°, and the
midshipman, crawling out upon all fours (for we
could not stand upright), declared he thought it was
our 18-pound carronade that was blown there and
had taken that position for a long shot. The fire
blew out of the stoves, and the glass out of the
window frames; the night as black as Erebus,
with heavy rain which formed a river that swept
everything before it; the chief part of our garden
washed or blown away, leaving nothing but the bare
rock behind, so that I wished myself in the old Bay
of Biscay again.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make up for this, the views about Hastings
are remarkably fine, and in the summer well worth
visiting; particularly the fish ponds, Dripping Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Lovers’ Seat, Friar’s Hill, Old Roar and many other
romantic spots, one of which I must mention.
About a mile to the NE of Hastings, from a place
called the Tile Kiln House, the prospect is highly
interesting; looking towards the town, is a valley
with a thicket on the left, and at the bottom a stream
that runs to the sea; in front, the west hill with the
ancient castle said to be built by William the Conqueror
soon after the battle of Hastings; and on
the east hill, the remains of a Roman camp. One
morning when the hounds were out, I was walking
near the above thicket when an immense boar
rushed furiously on the pack and the huntsmen
had great difficulty in separating them. The boar
belonged to the farmer near the spot, and some of
the dogs had reason to remember him.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I am better acquainted with handling a tar
brush, strapping a block, or turning in a dead-eye,
than describing green groves and gravel walks, I shall
say nothing more respecting the face of the country,
but begin upon other subjects. And here I must say
that during the time I had the station, I was upon
good terms with every individual from the mayor
down to the fisherman. But I regret to state that
death has made sad inroads among my worthy
friends since my departure. In the summer, the
cockneys would frequently come to take a look at
the French coast and Bonaparte’s tower on a clear
day; and not content with asking ridiculous questions,
would walk into the house without leave or licence,
and seat themselves. On one occasion, when I had
returned from Hastings, I found seated in my room
a fellow with his coat off and reading one of my
books. He took no notice of me for some time.
At last he drawled out ‘It’s werry hot veather.’ ‘It
is,’ I replied; ‘but pray what is your business?’
This question seemed to startle him, and particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>so when I informed him I was a man of war’s man,
and never suffered myself to be taken by storm or
boarded in the smoke. He took the hint and walked
off.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In stating this I only allude to a set who were
unacquainted with common politeness. At the
same time I have to acknowledge the civility and
attention I received from many of the respectable
families that visited Hastings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lower class at Hastings and in the vicinity
believe in witchcraft, and several old women that
lived in All Saints’ Street were supposed to be
witches. About a mile from my station lived
a poor old woman named Hannah Weller, who
was put down in the list; and many strange
stories were told respecting her—such as pigs, and
sheep, and sometimes oxen, refusing to pass her
dwelling, until the drovers would go and beg of
her to let them pass quietly. On my going one
morning to market at Hastings, I bought with
other articles some eggs, which I gave to Wm.
Crump (one of the signalmen), who put them at the
bottom of his basket well covered with straw so that
they could not be seen. I then told him to make
all haste he could to the station, and without his
knowing it I returned before him. When I had
got about a mile and a half from the town I met
Hannah Weller, who, I knew, was coming in at this
time with some clothes for the wash; and I told
her, if she met Crump, to tell him to make haste out
and to be careful of the eggs he had in the bottom
of his basket, and not to say she had seen me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Now Crump stood in great dread of Hannah, and
was a firm believer in deeds of the black art.
Soon after I had seen her she met Crump, and
desired him to be very careful of the eggs and to
make haste and not loiter by the way. Crump was
terrified almost out of his wits to think she should
know what cargo he had charge of; and, after
wishing her good morning, strode off without looking
behind until he got about a hundred yards from
her. He then took out his knife and stuck it in the
mark the ring of her patten (as he thought) had
made, and a sure way—if she looked round—to
prove witchcraft; and she, happening to look
round at the same time and seeing him stopping,
called out, ‘Crump, what are you about?’ and shaking her<a id='t257'></a>
hand, desired him to be gone, upon which he
took to his heels in amazement and arrived at the
station as pale as death, and told his woeful story to
the midshipman with many illustrations, which the
midshipman believed to be as true as holy writ.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had a tame raven, the most sagacious
creature I ever met with. He used to go every
morning with the signalman to town, for the letters
and to market, and would take his station at the
butcher’s shop long before we could get there; and
when he saw us ready to return, would set off for
home in a hurry. Sometimes we could see him
fighting with the crows; and once he alighted on
the head of a gentleman reading in a field; to his
consternation, until we explained to him Ralph’s
tricks. Under the Lovers’ Seat stands a house on
the beach called The Govers, which was inhabited
by a wicked fellow, a cobbler by trade. This man
took it into his head to leave off his wicked ways,
and went to church regularly every Sunday, and
paid great attention to the service for about three
or four months, and then relapsed to his former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>failings. On being asked the reason of his apostasy
he replied that he went to church until he was
tired; and seeing no use in it, he thought he might
as well go back to sin and cobble again as he could
get more by it than going to church. Early one
morning this fellow was gathering sticks in the
valley under the signal station, when our raven was
on the prowl. The moment Ralph got sight of him
he pitched on his neck and began to claw and tear
him most unmercifully, which alarmed him so much
that he had hardly power to defend himself. At
last he got hold of the raven, and, with part of the
thong he had to bind the sticks, he began to tie
Ralph’s legs, and when he thought he had him
secure he gathered up his sticks and was stooping
down to fasten them, when the raven broke loose,
and seized on him a second time, and tore his
breeches to rags after clawing him severely, and
then flew away. The cobbler, dreadfully alarmed,
went home without his sticks and told everyone
that he met that the devil had attacked him and
that he must alter his course of life, as he now
believed something was in it. The joke was kept
up, and I think he was never told it was our raven.
Poor Ralph at last met with an untimely death. A
farmer, shooting rooks, laid him low by mistake,
which he was very sorry for when too late.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the many cruisers that were on
the station and the unceasing look-out on the coast
by the officers of the customs, the smugglers
contrived to make several runs. One morning in
the month of November the midshipman called me
up a little before daylight, and reported that fifteen
horses were in the field near the station, with
Flushing jackets strapped on their backs, and made
fast to the hedge, without any one with them. As
the day began to break, I went to the brow of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the hill, and saw on the beach between two and
three hundred people, and a boat a short way from
the shore. The moment they got sight of me they
set up a shout, and made use of horrible threats.
However, I went down with the midshipman, and
found some customhouse officers who had been up
to their necks in water trying to get at the boat,
but all to no purpose. The fellows on board seemed
to be drunk, and held up some kegs which they
stove; and making use of language the most vile,
stood to the westward. I immediately dispatched
the midshipman to give information to the customhouse
and made the signal to the next station. A
galley was soon after manned and armed, and after
a long chase the smuggler was captured with several
tubs of liquor. As I returned to my station the
mob shewed their heads just above the brow of the
hill, and complimented me with three groans and
then dispersed; and glad I was to see them clear
off. They appeared to be all strangers, the customhouse
officers declaring they had never seen one of
them before. Some of them swore they would be
a shot in our locker the first opportunity, and we
expected they would have attacked us in the night;
but we heard no more of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now mention a few friends; and first the
Reverend Richard Wadeson, late Vicar of Fairlight,
who died since I left the station, aged eighty-nine.
He had formerly been second master at Harrow
School, when Dr. Parr was usher, and was offered
to be first master at the death or resignation of Dr.
Sumner, but refused it.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a> He was one of the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>men I ever met with, and one of the first classical
scholars in the kingdom, and highly respected by his
parishioners as the following account will shew. He
had, as vicar, only the small tithes; and when
requested by some of his friends to raise them he
refused, saying, he had lived on good terms in the
parish with every individual for a long time, and
that he would do nothing to forfeit their esteem and
would suffer anything rather than oppress them.
When this came to the knowledge of those who
paid tithes, they, as a mark of respect, immediately
made a handsome addition to his income, with a
high panegyric on his integrity. Nothing could put
him out of temper except losing at backgammon.
I well remember one evening his coming to the
station and saying he was determined not to be
vexed, let what would happen. We then began to
play (not for money), and he lost twenty games
running. At last he roared out, and on my asking
him what was the matter, says he, ‘He’s here.’
‘Who, sir?’ says I. ‘Why, the devil,’ says he, ‘is
at my elbow, but he shall not make a parson swear.’
I am sorry to say this worthy gentleman lost his
sight some years before his death, and, in addition
to this misfortune, had great domestic troubles
which he bore to the last with unshaken fortitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must not forget another worthy friend, the
Reverend Webster Whistler, Rector of Hastings
and New-Timber, who lately died at the advanced
age of eighty-seven. He also was a first-rate
scholar and a powerful preacher; a hater of bigotry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>and clerical tyranny; possessing great personal
courage, and one of the finest-looking men in the
kingdom; with an athletic frame, upwards of six
feet, and looked, when on horseback—as Napoleon
said of Kleber—like one of Homer’s heroes. His
kindness and attention I never shall forget. I was
always welcome to his house and he always sent me
a large tithe, as he called it, of fruit and game,
whenever he had an opportunity. I could mention
many acts of this kind; but one mark of respect I
cannot pass over. When my mother died, he
selected a particular spot for her grave where he
knew the ground was dry, refused all fees, and even
assisted in placing the turf over her remains. He
was not one of your dandy parsons either in dress
or address; for he was not ashamed to wear a rusty
black coat, or to knock down anyone that offended
him. I remember a dragoon officer addressing him
one morning with, ‘Damn me, how are you,
Whistler?’ ‘If you say that again, I will fell you
to the earth,’ was his reply. Going into a boat,
and having on an old black coat and trowsers, he
asked me who I thought he was like, repeating the
following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sordid his garb, but in his looks were seen</div>
      <div class='line'>A youthful vigour, and autumnal green.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘Can you,’ says he, ‘with all the antiquity you
smatter, find out who I allude to?’ ‘Charon, sir,’
says I. ‘Right,’ says he, ‘I’m the man; but I am
not going on the Styx to-day. The Channel shall
be my cruising ground this morning’; and off he
started with some ladies in company. On his return
he came up to the station, foaming with rage, requesting
me to inform him the name of the cutter
in the offing, that he might report her commander
to the admiralty for daring to fire at him. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the fact was this. The cutter had fired at some
boats to bring them to, as the fishermen had frequently
smuggled goods on board; and Mr. Whistler
having boarded one of them to get fish, the commander
of the cutter fired several muskets at his
boat, thinking him a smuggler also, which made the
parson pull to land as fast as possible. It was out
of my power to give him the name, as I had not
her number. ‘Well, then,’ says he, ‘the first time
I can lay hold of him I’ll christen him in the Bourne
stream, by giving him a good ducking.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The beginning of December 1814 the admiralty
directed me to pay off the station without loss of
time, and the next day I received a letter from the
navy board to the same purpose, and further directing
me to clear the station of the stores under my
charge, and to sell all unserviceable articles. Now
all this was very well, and they concluded by saying,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We are your Affectionate Friends<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a>——</div>
      <div class='line in8'>(Signed by three commissioners);</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>but on the margin of their letter was a postscript as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘You are to discharge your midshipman and
men on the receipt of this letter; and yourself, as
soon as these instructions have been complied with.’</p>

<p class='c007'>So by this I was to do everything myself, which
was very kind, in the dead of winter, three miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>from Hastings, and a long way from the spring where
we had our water, and nothing to be had in the
neighbourhood; and upon a hill, said to be 650 feet
above the level of the sea—so that if a snowstorm
came on I might remain there alone and starve and
be damned for what some people cared. However,
I got a merchant at Hastings to send his wagons
out and take the stores to his warehouse, until a
vessel was sent to receive them; and after selling
the coals and fire stack, I paid off the station on
the 7th of December 1814.</p>

    <div class='c002'><em>The ‘swaggering blue pennant.’</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>[As the distinctive pennants for Transport Officers when
afloat were done away with several years ago, and indeed
Transport Officers afloat are now almost unknown, we are
happy in being able, by the kindness of Vice-Admiral
George T. H. Boyes, the present Director of Transports,
to give the Regulations, as they stood in 1814, ‘relative to
the pennants of distinction’ appointed to be used by transport
agents when afloat.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal agent, serving on any expedition, in
order to be particularly known and distinguished, shall
wear, on board the transport wherein he is embarked, a
blue ensign, together with a plain blue broad pennant at
the main topmast head, of the following dimensions, viz.
eight feet at the staff, and twenty feet long; but, for foul
weather, four feet at the staff, and ten feet long.</p>

<p class='c008'>When there is but one agent to a division of transports,
or when several agents are not serving under the immediate
orders of other agents, a blue ensign with the common
blue pennant at the main topmast head is to be
worn as the only necessary mark of distinction. The
broad pennant is never to be hoisted by any agent who has
not another under him.</p>

<p class='c008'>All inferior agents shall hoist the blue ensign and a
plain blue common pennant, two feet broad at the head,
and thirty feet long. A smaller one, at discretion, may
be worn at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should transports of different expeditions meet at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>same port, the principal agents only of each expedition
are to hoist broad pennants at the main, fore, or mizen
topmast heads, according to their respective rank in his
Majesty’s navy: and the inferior agents, belonging to
each expedition, are to hoist common blue pennants at the
same masthead with their principal.</p>

<p class='c008'>At sea, should a large fleet of transports, all on the
same service, be classed in three grand divisions, the agent
commanding each division may hoist the broad pennant
at the main, fore, or mizen topmast heads, according to
their rank, as aforesaid; and their inferior agents in like
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. It is not out of place to mention here what we were told
many years ago by an officer of the Conway, that the late Professor
Montague Burrows, when a lieutenant of the Winchester, was
initiated in the mysteries of the Greek Grammar by the late Sir
Anthony Hoskins, then a cadet fresh from Westminster. Burrows
afterwards took a first class in classics at Oxford.</p>

a youngster to be at school while his name was on the ship’s
books. When—as in this case—the boy was his father’s servant,
he might be on board while the ship was in a home port.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. This was then usual. Probably the fate of the Ramillies
had a good deal to do with putting it out of fashion, as it certainly
had with forcing seamen to consider that there was a right and a
wrong tack on which to lie to; and may thus be said to have
brought about the discovery of the Law of Storms.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. There is no reason to doubt the fact; but, in the absence of
Christian name and date, the court martial cannot be traced; nor
can any man of the name be found, as surgeon, in the pay-books

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. The very persistent way in which this story of the loss of
the Royal George was spread abroad from the first, the entire
suppression of the evidence (on oath) to the contrary, as given at
the court martial, and the fact (here and elsewhere so strongly
commented on) that care was taken to prevent the success of the
proposed attempts to raise her, all point to one conclusion from
which it is difficult to escape—the conscious guilt of some high-placed
and influential officials of the Navy Board. Cf. <cite>Naval
Miscellany</cite> (<em>N.R.S.</em> xx.) p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>; and <em>D.N.B.</em> <em>s.nn.</em> Durham, Sir

<p class='c008'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. A ‘scuttle’ is defined by Falconer as ‘a small hatchway cut
for some particular purpose through a ship’s deck, or through the
coverings of the hatchways’; ‘scuttling’ is ‘the act of cutting
large holes through the bottom or sides of a ship.’ A ‘scuttle butt’
was a large cask, whose bung-hole had been cut into a
small scuttle, secured on the main deck in some convenient place,
to hold water for present use. It may be well to say that ‘scuttles’
to light the orlop deck were quite unknown till long after the
great war.</p>

a dark-red stream of fire rushing down from the hill. Crugal sat

<p class='c008'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. Without quite being ‘one of the first mathematicians in
Europe,’ it is probable enough that Macbride was really an able
man. The old schoolmasters were of two sorts: either they were
respectable, half-educated men, who were rising in life and sometimes
became pursers, occasionally even lieutenants; or, and
more commonly, they were clever, highly educated men, ruined
by drink, and on the down grade. We may believe that Macbride
was a man of this stamp. <em>Cf.</em> also Byam Martin’s experience
on board the Pegasus (<em>N.R.S.</em> xxiv. 57). Some of our most distinguished
captains and admirals endeavoured, at their own
expense, to remedy this utterly disgraceful state of things:—<em>e.g.</em>
Pellew in the Caledonia, Sir Samuel Hood in the Centaur; but it
was not till 1836 that the Admiralty tried to make an entirely new
departure by the institution of naval instructors. Complete success,
however, came very gradually. Some of the earlier officers
so appointed were not uncommonly put to bed by a <em>posse</em> of their
pupils; and even less than fifty years ago, one of them—a capable
instructor and a clever writer—went on four days’ leave to his cabin,
in company with half a dozen of brandy. All might have gone
well—from his point of view—had not the supply run short after
two days, and the wretched man, in his night shirt and a state
bordering on <em>delirium tremens</em>, appeared in the ward room clamouring

<p class='c008'><a href='#r118'>118</a>. Mr. Marriott, Assistant Secretary of the Royal Meteorological
Society, has kindly supplied the following note:—The frost
began about the middle of December 1794, was excessively
severe in January, and continued till the end of March. There
were large falls of snow, and the consequent floods were so great
that nearly all the bridges in England were injured. The greatest
cold recorded was at Maidstone on January 25, when a thermometer
laid on the snow showed –14° F., and another, five feet
above the surface, –10° F. There was a thaw on January 26–7,
but on the 28th the frost returned and continued. Mr. A. Rollin,
secretary to the captain superintendent at Sheerness, has also been
so good as to send the following note, at the instance of Rear-Admiral
C. H. Adair: ‘In January 1795 King’s Ferry was frozen
and also Sheerness Harbour. People walked from ships in the
harbour and from the Little Nore to Sheerness on the ice for provisions.’
Mr. Rollin mentions similar frosts in January 1776, and
January 1789; but has no record of the frost of January 1855,
when the harbour, and seaward as far as the eye could reach, was
frozen over, forcibly recalling Arctic memories.</p>

still with us who have heard Braham—he did not retire finally
till 1852—if only in ‘The Bay of Biscay.’ Incledon, who died in
1826, served, when a very young man, as an ordinary seaman on
board the Formidable, Rodney’s flagship in the West Indies.
According to the tradition still living 50 or 60 years ago, his talent
was found out, and he used to be sent for, first to the ward room
and afterwards to the admiral’s cabin, to sing after dinner; and when
the ship paid off, he came on shore provided with letters of introduction
which made the rest of his way easy. The details of his
service in the navy, as given in the <em>D.N.B.</em>, are certainly erroneous.
The Formidable did not go to the West Indies till 1782; and
Cleland did not then command her.</p>

The distance from Fairlight to Boulogne and the adjacent coast

<p class='c008'><a href='#r163'>163</a>. There is some confusion here. Wadeson and Parr were
both assistant masters when Sumner died suddenly in September,
1771. Wadeson was certainly not offered the succession, and his
name does not seem to have been officially mentioned in connection
with it. On the other hand, Parr’s claims were strongly
urged, and the refusal of the Governors to appoint him caused
a violent ‘meeting’ among the boys. It is a very strange story,
told at length in Johnstone, <cite>Works of Samuel Parr</cite>, i. 55 <em>seq.</em>;
Thornton, <cite>Harrow School and its Surroundings</cite>, Chap. viii.;
